    <div class="card-body">
      <p>The best letters come from faculty who know you well beyond your grade in a class. They can speak to your skills, character, and potential in detail. Before requesting a letter, please consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Did you actively participate in my class?</b> Did you attend office hours, ask thoughtful questions, or contribute to discussions?</li>
        <li><b>Have you worked with me in a research capacity?</b> This provides the strongest basis for a detailed, impactful letter.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
        If we haven't had much interaction beyond coursework, I encourage you to seek a letter from another professor who knows you better. My goal is for you to have the most compelling application possible!

## Purpose

The Kahveci Group at <a class="off" href="https://www.luc.edu">Loyola University Chicago</a> works at the interface of affective dimensions
in chemistry education research. We apply quantitative research methods to analyze data and understand how learning complex chemistry topics is influenced by affective variables in relation to personal characteristics. Additionally, we are interested in studying dominant modalities of remote learning as an extension of the post pandemic influences on the practice of chemistry education.

If you're reading this webpage, you're probably a researcher in the field of chemistry education research (CER) or a student of mine. I have a [blog](/blog) on both [research](/projects) and [teaching](/courses). If you'd like to stay updated with the latest trends, best practices, and chemistry education research, please consider <a href='https://tinyletter.com/mkahveci'>subscribing</a> our group's newsletter.

## Source code

[kahveci.pw](https://kahveci.pw) is built based on the source code of [bedford.io](https://github.com/blab/blotter), which is freely available at the [GitHub](https://github.com/blab/blotter).  This repo is placed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/blab/blotter#license).

### 1. Build site

To build the website locally, clone the repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/blab/blotter.git
```

Then install necessary Ruby dependencies by running `bundle install` from within the `blotter` directory.  After this, the site can be be built with:

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

(If you are getting errors at this stage, it may be due to your version of `bundle`. Try `gem uninstall bundler` + `gem install bundler -v 1.13.1`.)

To view the site, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and point a browser to `http://localhost:4000/`.  More information on Jekyll can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).

To include projects, preprocessing scripts are necessary to clone project repos and update Jekyll metadata. This can be accomplished with:

```
ruby _scripts/update-and-preprocess.rb
```

Then `jekyll build` works as normal.

### 2. Contribute

Blog posts just require YAML top matter that looks something like:

```
---
layout: post
title: Newton Institute presentation
author: Trevor Bedford
link: http://www.newton.ac.uk/programmes/IDD/seminars/2013082213301.html
image: /images/blog/transmission.png
---
```

The `layout`, `title` and `author` tags are required, while `link` and `image` are optional.  Just save a Markdown file with this top matter as something like `blog/_posts/2013-08-27-newton-institute.md`, where `2013-08-27` is the date of the post and `newton-institute` is the short title.  This short title is used in the URL of the post, so this becomes `blog/newton-institute/`, so the short title should be long enough and unique enough not to cause conflicts with other posts.

## Introduction

This is a style guide to help in formatting Markdown content for the site.  In general, I've tried to adhere to GitHub style, with the intention that anything that renders on GitHub will render here as well.  The following isn't meant to be exhaustive, just a reminder of what's possible with Markdown.

------------------

## Headings

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

## Text styling

```
Italicize text by surrounding it in *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Bold text by surrounding it with **double asterisks** or __double underscores__.
Combine with **_double asterisks plus underscores_**.
Strike-through text with ~~double tildes~~.
Superscript contiguous text with carrots like x^2y, surround with parentheses for more complex expressions like x^(2y + 3z).
```

## Images

Images work like links, but with a prefaced !.  This supports SVG as well PNG, JPG, etc...

```
![](/images/logo.svg)
```

![](/images/logo.svg)

------------------

Can always drop in HTML, so sizing adjustments can be done with:

```
<img style="width:30px;" src="/images/logo.svg"/>
```

<img style="width:30px;" src="/images/logo.svg"/>

------------------

## Code

```
A bit of inline monospaced font can be made `by surrounding text with backticks`.
```

A bit of inline monospaced font can be made `by surrounding text with backticks`.

------------------

Larger code blocks can be made by surrounding the block with three backticks <code>```</code>, and code can be highlighted by specifying language after the backticks, like so:

    ```javascript
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
    ```

    ```ruby
    s = "Ruby syntax highlighting";
    puts s
    ```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```ruby
s = "Ruby syntax highlighting";
puts s
```

## Tables

3A       | 3B       | 3C       | 3D
```

## Blockquotes

```
> The data we have is not the data we want, and the data we need is not the data we have.
```

> The data we have is not the data we want, and the data we need is not the data we have.


------------------

## Horizontal rule

Use three of more hyphens, asterisks or underscores.

```

## Line breaks

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated by two newlines, so it will be a separate paragraph.

This line is also a separate paragraph, though...
Adding a single line break does not create a new paragraph.

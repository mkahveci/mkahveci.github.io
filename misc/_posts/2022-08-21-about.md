## Purpose

The Kahveci Group at [Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu) operates at the interface of affective dimensions in chemistry education research. We specialize in applying quantitative research methods to analyze data and understand how the learning of complex chemistry topics is influenced by affective variables in relation to personal characteristics. Our interest also extends to studying dominant modalities of remote learning, particularly in the context of post-pandemic influences on the practice of chemistry education.

If you're visiting this webpage, you might be a researcher in the field of chemistry education research (CER) or one of my students. I maintain a [blog](/blog) covering topics related to both [research](/projects) and [teaching](/courses). If you're interested in staying updated with the latest trends, best practices, and developments in chemistry education research, please consider [subscribing](https://tinyletter.com/mkahveci) to our group's newsletter.

## Source code

[kahveci.pw](https://kahveci.pw) is built on the source code of [bedford.io](https://github.com/blab/blotter), which is freely available on GitHub. This [repo](https://github.com/blab/blotter) is under the [MIT license](https://github.com/blab/blotter#license). For more information:

### `kahveci.pw` Updates & New Features

* The [Biking Activities](/biking) module is written. [See here](/format) for instructions on how to add data to this module.
* The [Courses](/courses) module has been created.
* A new tagging feature has been added to the [Blog](/blog) module. A new ['Tags'](/blog/tags/) menu item is now available in the interface.
* The [Team](/team) module is updated with more auto-generated content for each team member. Notably, the `Principal Investigator` has a complete auto-curated CV from multiple data sources of [`kahveci.pw`](https://kahveci.pw).
* The original [repo](https://github.com/blab/blotter) had only the `articles` module. This functionality is expanded to a new `Publications` module. Currently, there are three types of publications available:
  * Books
  * Journal Papers
  * Conference Papers
* The [Projects](/projects) module was re-written so that all projects are hosted on the `kahveci.pw` domain. Github integration is achieved via `some-project-repo.git` or the project URL. Project-based publications are auto-populated.
* Effective on 12/15/23, the logo of [kahveci.pw](https://kahveci.pw) was changed as follows:

## Purpose

The Kahveci Group operates at the interface of affective dimensions in chemistry education research. We specialize in applying quantitative research methods to analyze data and understand how the learning of complex chemistry topics is influenced by affective variables in relation to personal characteristics. Our interest also extends to studying dominant modalities of remote learning, particularly in the context of post-pandemic influences on the practice of chemistry education.

If you're visiting this webpage, you might be a researcher in the field of chemistry education research (CER) or one of my students. I maintain a [blog](/blog) covering topics related to both [research](/projects) and [teaching](/courses). If you're interested in staying updated with the latest trends, best practices, and developments in chemistry education research, please consider [subscribing](https://tinyletter.com/mkahveci) to our group's newsletter.

## Source code

[kahveci.pw](https://kahveci.pw) is built on the source code of [bedford.io](https://github.com/blab/blotter), which is freely available on GitHub. This [repo](https://github.com/blab/blotter) is under the [MIT license](https://github.com/blab/blotter#license). For more information:

* Review our metadata [format](/format) guide
* Check out the Markdown [style](/style) guide
* Explore our [code](/code) snippets guide

### `kahveci.pw` Updates & New Features

* The [Biking Activities](/biking) module is written. [See here](/format) for instructions on how to add data to this module.
* The [Courses](/courses) module has been created.
* A new tagging feature has been added to the [Blog](/blog) module. A new ['Tags'](/blog/tags/) menu item is now available in the interface.
* The [Team](/team) module is updated with more auto-generated content for each team member. Notably, the `Principal Investigator` has a complete auto-curated CV from multiple data sources of [`kahveci.pw`](https://kahveci.pw).
* The original [repo](https://github.com/blab/blotter) had only the `articles` module. This functionality is expanded to a new `Publications` module. Currently, there are three types of publications available:
  * Books
  * Journal Papers
  * Conference Papers
* The [Projects](/projects) module was re-written so that all projects are hosted on the `kahveci.pw` domain. Github integration is achieved via `some-project-repo.git` or the project URL. Project-based publications are auto-populated.

### Historical Overview of Logos Used by `kahveci.pw`

#### Current Active Logo

_Figure 3._ AI-Enhanced Logo Design, Version 2 of Logo B

The current iteration of our logo, in use since December 23, 2023, is a testament to the blend of art and technology. This AI-enhanced design features a striking metallic texture complemented by 3D effects and dynamic lighting. Set against a backdrop of a space-themed gradient, the design elements are skillfully arranged to convey a sense of motion, effectively capturing the essence of animation. This logo not only marks our brand's evolution but also symbolizes our commitment to innovation and modern aesthetics.

#### Logo B: Usage Period from December 15, 2023, to December 22, 2023

_Figure 2._ Logo B - AI-Generated Kahveci Group Design

Logo B for the Kahveci Group is an AI-generated masterpiece, distinguished by an array of random chemistry symbols. Drawing inspiration from the Turkish word 'Kahveci,' meaning 'Coffee Maker' or 'Barista,' the logo prominently features a steamy coffee cup at its center. This choice resonates deeply with the essence of the Kahveci brand and was an intuitive decision during the AI-driven design process. The logo also pays homage to my personal stimulants of choice - coffee, black tea, and hazelnuts - which have been essential in powering through extensive study sessions. This unique and meaningful logo adorned the Kahveci Group from December 15, 2023, to December 22, 2023, symbolizing a brief but impactful chapter in our brand's history.

#### Logo A: Usage Period from January 1, 2013, to December 15, 20233

_Figure 1._ Logo A - Schrödinger Equation Theme

This logo, which I meticulously crafted using the TikZ package in LaTeX, represents a fusion of my passion for physical chemistry and education. It features an elegant design inspired by the Schrödinger equation, rendered in crisp vector graphics through ghostscript, PDF, or SVG formats. Emblematic of my personal style and academic pursuits, it served as a true reflection of my identity. Logo A was actively used from January 1, 2013, to December 15, 2023, maintaining its elegance and relevance throughout its tenure.

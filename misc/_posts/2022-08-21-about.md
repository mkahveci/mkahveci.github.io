{% include knx.html %} explores the intersection of emotions and learning in chemistry education. We use quantitative research methods to understand how personal factors and emotions influence students' understanding of complex chemistry topics. We are also interested in the changing landscape of remote learning, especially after the pandemic.

{% include knx.html %} provides resources for chemistry education researchers, students, and anyone interested in the latest trends and best practices in the field.

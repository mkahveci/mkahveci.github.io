## Purpose

The Kahveci Group at <a class="off" href="https://www.luc.edu">Loyola University Chicago</a> works at the interface of affective dimensions
in chemistry education research. We apply quantitative research methods to analyze data and understand how learning complex chemistry topics is influenced by affective variables in relation to personal characteristics. Additionally, we are interested in studying dominant modalities of remote learning as an extension of the post pandemic influences on the practice of chemistry education.

If you're reading this webpage, you're probably a researcher in the field of chemistry education research (CER) or a student of mine. I have a [blog](/blog) on both [research](/projects) and [teaching](/courses). If you'd like to stay updated with the latest trends, best practices, and chemistry education research, please consider <a href='https://tinyletter.com/mkahveci'>subscribing</a> our group's newsletter.

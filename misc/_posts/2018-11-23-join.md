*We are working on chemistry education from high school level to undergraduate levels*. The areas of research interests are on affective aspects of chemistry learning, teaching effectiveness through educational technology, and hard-to-teach chemical concepts such as physical chemistry topics.

<h2>Research fellows</h2>

New ideas on joint proposals and publications are welcome.

<h2>Publishers</h2>

We are always eager to publish our studies to reach out the wider community.

<h2>Graduate students</h2>

If you are in need of an external committee member for your graduate degree, please do not hesitate to contact [Dr. Murat Kahveci](/team/murat-kahveci/).

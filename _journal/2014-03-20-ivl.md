Relying on PISA 2003 data, the study investigated students’ anxiety, motivation, self-efficacy, and self-concept on learning mathematics. The analysis was carried out over large amount of data, collected from 272138 students who were 15-16 years of age, coming from 41 countries. Two-stage stratified sampling strategy provided the sample for the analysis. Findings showed that

* boys have significantly higher mathematical self-efficacy, self-concept, motivation and lower mathematics anxiety than girls,
* students with higher socioeconomic status have higher self-efficacy, self-concept and motivation whereas students with the highest mathematics anxiety are in medium socioeconomic level, and
* self-efficacy, self-concept, motivation and anxiety differ significantly with respect to geographical regions.

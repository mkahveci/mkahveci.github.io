## Synopsis

This project, supported by the **National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS)** through the **BioLEAP Classroom Grant**, aims to enhance humane science education. The grant funds the acquisition and implementation of specialized resources to support humane anatomy lessons during the 2025/2026 school year. Hosted at Chicago Public Schools, this initiative focuses on providing students with high-quality, ethical educational materials to foster learning in biology and anatomy.

## Project Acronym

**BioLEAP**

**BioLEAP**: Biology Education Advancement Program (Grant Program by NAVS)

## Project Description

1.  **Objective**: The primary goal of this project is to support humane science education efforts. By securing funding for specific educational materials, the project aims to facilitate humane anatomy lessons that align with modern ethical standards in science education.

2.  **Implementation Strategy**: The project involves the acquisition of approved materials requested in the grant application. These materials will be integrated into the classroom curriculum to support student learning targets in science and anatomy.

3.  **Documentation and Dissemination**: A key component of the project is documenting the implementation of these new resources. This includes capturing high-resolution images and video footage of students actively using the materials to demonstrate engagement and educational impact. These visual assets may be used by the Society in outreach materials to promote humane science education.

4.  **Evaluation and Reflection**: To ensure the effectiveness of the resources, the project includes a program evaluation phase. A comprehensive evaluation form will be completed by June 15, 2026, assessing the impact of the materials on the curriculum and student experience. Additionally, the recipient will participate in an interview to share insights and experiences regarding the project.

5.  **Outcomes**: The immediate outcome is the enhancement of the classroom inventory with $1,000 worth of humane science education materials. Long-term outcomes include fostering a classroom environment that prioritizes ethical scientific inquiry and providing students with modern, high-quality learning tools.

### Conclusion

The BioLEAP Classroom Grant represents a commitment to ethical and effective science teaching. By partnering with the National Anti-Vivisection Society, this project ensures that students have access to resources that support rigorous scientific learning while adhering to humane principles. The project will be executed during the 2025/2026 school year, contributing to the broader goal of advancing humane education in K-12 settings.

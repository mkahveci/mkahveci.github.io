## Synopsis

This project aims to examine the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) on academic integrity in a U.S. college context. It explores the perceptions and experiences of various university stakeholders (students, faculty, librarians, administrators, and staff) regarding the use and misuse of AI tools such as ChatGPT in academic settings. It also investigates the current policies and practices of academic integrity and the potential strategies to educate and empower stakeholders to engage with AI tools ethically and appropriately. The project adopts a participatory action research (PAR) approach and collects data through a survey and group interviews. The project will contribute to the literature on AI and academic integrity by providing insights and recommendations from a critical pedagogy perspective.

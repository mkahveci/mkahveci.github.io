>Dear Dr. Kahveci,
>
>I just wanted to say thank you for a good semester! I enjoyed the different labs that we did and all the new information that we learned. I also appreciate how the information aligned with what we learned in Chem 102 lecture. It made me feel like I was getting extra information about the topics and seeing them be conceptualized. I enjoyed how hands-off you were as well because it allowed me to explore the topics on my own and work with group members.

>Thanks again for your help through the semester. Have a great summer!

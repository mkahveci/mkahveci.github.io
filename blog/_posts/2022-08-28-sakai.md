## Introduction

[Sakai](https://sakai.luc.edu) is our LMS at <a class="off" href="https://www.luc.edu">Loyola University Chicago</a>. This post will include some setups I often use and since these steps are needed only every semester, I prefer to write them down as a reminder for myself, while hoping that the post would also be useful for my readers. This post will be expanded in the future as new setups needed.

## Common Tasks

### 1. Copying a Course from a Project Page in Sakai

As an instructor, login Sakai and navigate to your new course that you need to add new content. Follow these steps:

* `Site Info` > `Import from Site`, if one imports from a `Project Site` within `Sakai`. You should be added to the `Project Site` in order to see it as an import option. 
* As a precaution, I always select `I would like to merge my data` in the next step.
* Select the `Project Site` that you want to copy its contents. A nice feature of `Import from Site` in `Sakai` is you can import from multiple `Project Sites` in this step.
* The import process is typically completed in 2 minutes. 
* On 8/28/2022: My test today turned out to be with errors, actually. The issue was `Assignments` and `Tests & Quizzes` modules failed to import. After the third attempt with `I would like to replace my data` option selected, those modules were copied as expected. As I did not see any error messages, I had no idea about the source of this error. 

### 2. Adding a TA to Your Course

An instructor cannot add or remove course participants including TAs. It has to be done via the ITS Service Portal.

* Log in [https://luc.saasit.com](https://luc.saasit.com)
* Search `Sakai`
* Click `Sakai enrollment`
* Fill out the work order form.

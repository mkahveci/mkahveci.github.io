## Introduction

[Sakai](https://sakai.luc.edu) is our LMS at <a class="off" href="https://www.luc.edu">Loyola University Chicago</a>. This post will include some setups I often use and since these steps are needed only every semester, I prefer to write them down as a reminder for myself, while hoping that the post would also be useful for my readers. This post will be expanded in the future as new setups needed.

## Common Tasks

### Copying a Course from a Project Page in Sakai

As an instructor, login Sakai and navigate to your new course that you need to add new content. Follow these steps:
* `Site Info` > `Import from Site`, if one imports from a `Project Site` within `Sakai`. You should be added to the `Project Site` in order to see it as an import option. 
* As a precaution, I always select `I would like to merge my data` in the next step.
* Select the `Project Site` that you want to copy its contents. A nice feature of `Import from Site` in `Sakai` is you can import from multiple `Project Sites` in this step.

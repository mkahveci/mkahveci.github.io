In the ever-evolving landscape of education, educators constantly seek effective strategies to enhance student learning and engagement. One such strategy that has gained significant traction is the use of learning targets in conjunction with the Formative Learning Cycle Framework. This powerful combination empowers students to take ownership of their learning journey and provides teachers with a roadmap for effective instruction and assessment.

## **What Exactly are Learning Targets?**

Learning targets are concise, student-friendly descriptions of what students should know, understand, and be able to do by the end of a lesson or unit[^1]. They act as clear and specific goals that guide students' learning process. Unlike traditional instructional objectives, which are often teacher-centric, learning targets are designed to be accessible and meaningful to students, enabling them to actively participate in their educational journey[^3].

Effective learning targets are:

* **Clearly defined:** They use precise language that avoids ambiguity and ensures students understand what is expected of them.
* **Student-friendly:** They are written in a language that students can easily comprehend, using age-appropriate vocabulary and avoiding jargon.
* **Specific and measurable:** They focus on a particular skill or concept and provide a clear indication of what mastery looks like.
* **Attainable:** They are challenging yet achievable, encouraging students to strive for success.

Furthermore, learning targets can be categorized into four distinct types[^4]:

* **Knowledge Targets:** These focus on factual information, concepts, and vocabulary. Examples include: "I can identify the parts of a plant cell" or "I can define the term 'metaphor'."
* **Reasoning Targets:** These emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, and analysis. Examples include: "I can explain the causes of the American Civil War" or "I can compare and contrast different types of renewable energy sources."
* **Skill Targets:** These center on the development of specific skills, such as writing, reading, or mathematical computation. Examples include: "I can write a persuasive essay with a clear thesis statement" or "I can solve quadratic equations."
* **Product Targets:** These involve the creation of a tangible product, such as a research paper, a science project, or a work of art. Examples include: "I can design and conduct an experiment to test the effects of different fertilizers on plant growth" or "I can create a painting that uses light and shadow to create depth."

## **The Formative Learning Cycle Framework: A Guiding Light**

The Formative Learning Cycle Framework provides a structured approach to using assessment to inform instruction and improve student learning. It involves a continuous cycle of setting clear learning goals, gathering evidence of student learning, interpreting that evidence, and using it to adjust instruction and provide feedback[^5]. This iterative process allows teachers to tailor their teaching to meet the individual needs of their students and to create a dynamic learning environment where students are actively involved in monitoring their progress.

A key aspect of the Formative Learning Cycle Framework is the emphasis on student self-assessment and reflection[^6]. By encouraging students to actively participate in evaluating their own learning, teachers empower them to take ownership of their educational journey. This fosters a sense of responsibility and encourages students to become more self-directed learners.

## **Creating Learning Targets with the Formative Learning Cycle Framework**

Now that we have a solid understanding of the Formative Learning Cycle Framework, let's explore how it can be used to create effective learning targets. The framework provides a valuable structure for this process:

1. **Clearly outline the key concepts and skills:** Start by clearly outlining the key concepts, knowledge, and skills that students should acquire by the end of the lesson or unit. These goals should be aligned with curriculum standards and learning objectives[^7]. For example, in a unit on fractions, a learning goal might be for students to understand how to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators.
2. **Transform goals into student-friendly targets:** Translate these learning goals into clear, concise, and student-friendly language. Use "I can" statements to make the targets more personal and actionable for students 1. For instance, the learning goal mentioned above could be transformed into the learning target: "I can add and subtract fractions with different denominators."
3. **Gather evidence of student learning:** Implement a variety of formative assessment methods, such as observations, quizzes, exit tickets, and student self-assessments, to gather evidence of student learning throughout the lesson or unit[^9]. For example, you could use a quick quiz to assess students' understanding of finding common denominators, or you could observe students working in small groups to solve fraction problems.
4. **Analyze evidence and provide feedback:** Carefully analyze the collected evidence to identify areas where students are excelling and areas where they may need additional support. Provide timely and specific feedback to students, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement[^10]. For instance, if many students struggle with a particular concept on a quiz, you could provide targeted feedback and reteach the concept the following day.
5. **Adjust instruction:** Based on the analysis of student learning evidence, adjust your instruction to address any misconceptions or gaps in understanding 6. This may involve reteaching concepts, providing differentiated instruction, or offering additional practice opportunities. For example, if students struggle with adding fractions with unlike denominators, you might provide visual aids or manipulatives to help them grasp the concept. You could also differentiate instruction by providing more challenging problems for advanced learners and additional support for those who need it.

## **Incorporating the Four-Column Framework**

To further enhance the creation of learning targets, consider incorporating the four-column framework from snippet[^11]:

| What am I learning? | What will I be able to do? | How will I be asked to show that I can do it? | How will I know I can do this? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| The concept of fractions with unlike denominators | Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators | Solve word problems involving fractions with unlike denominators; Complete a worksheet with practice problems | I can accurately solve 80% of the problems on the worksheet |

This framework encourages a deeper understanding of the learning target by prompting students to consider not only what they are learning but also how they will demonstrate their understanding and how they will know they have achieved mastery. By using this framework in conjunction with the Formative Learning Cycle, teachers can create comprehensive and effective learning targets that guide student learning and provide a clear path to success.

## **Examples of Learning Targets Created with the Formative Learning Cycle Framework**

Here are a few examples of learning targets created using the Formative Learning Cycle Framework:

* **Math:** I can explain the relationship between decimals and fractions and convert between the two forms. This target aligns with the learning goal of understanding the connection between decimals and fractions. To gather evidence of learning, students could complete a worksheet with conversion problems or participate in a class activity where they represent decimals and fractions using visual models4.
* **Science:** I can design and conduct an experiment to test the effects of different variables on plant growth. This target stems from the learning goal of understanding the scientific method and the factors that influence plant growth. Students could demonstrate their learning by conducting an experiment, collecting data, and presenting their findings in a lab report4.
* **Language Arts:** I can analyze a character's motivations and explain how they contribute to the plot of a story. This target is derived from the learning goal of understanding character development and plot structure. Students could demonstrate their learning by writing an essay analyzing a character from a novel or participating in a class discussion about character motivations4.

## **Conclusion: Why This Approach Matters**

Using the Formative Learning Cycle Framework to create and implement learning targets offers several benefits:

* **Increased student engagement and motivation:** When students understand what they are learning and why it is important, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to succeed. Learning targets provide students with a clear sense of purpose and direction, making their learning more meaningful and relevant[^12].
* **Improved student learning outcomes:** By providing clear goals and regular feedback, learning targets help students focus their efforts and monitor their progress, leading to improved learning outcomes. When students know what they are aiming for, they can better track their progress and identify areas where they need to focus their attention[^12].
* **Enhanced teacher effectiveness:** The Formative Learning Cycle Framework provides teachers with a structured approach to assessment and instruction, allowing them to make data-driven decisions and tailor their teaching to meet the needs of all learners. By continuously gathering and analyzing evidence of student learning, teachers can identify areas where students are excelling and areas where they may need additional support[^12].
* **A more student-centered learning environment:** By shifting the focus from teacher-directed instruction to student-owned learning, learning targets empower students to take an active role in their education. When students are involved in setting learning targets and monitoring their progress, they become more invested in their learning and develop a sense of ownership over their educational journey[^12].
* **Enhanced Student Ownership of Learning:** Learning targets provide a sense of clarity and transparency. By aligning learning targets with curriculum standards and district-wide goals, schools can ensure that all students are working towards the same high expectations[^12].

In conclusion, learning targets and the Formative Learning Cycle Framework are powerful tools that can transform the learning experience for both students and teachers. By providing clear goals, ongoing feedback, and opportunities for self-reflection, this approach fosters a dynamic and effective learning environment where students thrive and reach their full potential. By embracing the power of learning targets and the Formative Learning Cycle Framework, educators can create a classroom where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their own learning journey.

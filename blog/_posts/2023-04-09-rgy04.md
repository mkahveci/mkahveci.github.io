Dual-process theories propose that human decision-making involves two separate cognitive systems: a fast, automatic, intuitive system (System 1) and a slower, reflective, deliberate system (System 2)[^1]. Social-emotional learning (SEL) is related to dual-process theories because it involves the development of both automatic and reflective processes for managing emotions, regulating behavior, and making decisions.

SEL interventions aim to strengthen both System 1 and System 2 processes. For example, teaching students to recognize and label their emotions (System 1) and then to regulate their behavior based on their goals and values (System 2)[^2]. SEL also involves developing metacognitive skills that help individuals become more aware of their thinking processes and make more deliberate, intentional decisions[^3].

## Examples of Applying Dual-Process Theories to Social Emotional Learning

One example of applying dual-process theories to SEL is the use of mindfulness practices in the classroom. Mindfulness involves paying attention to present moment experiences with an attitude of openness and non-judgment[^4]. Mindfulness practices can strengthen System 1 processes by increasing students' awareness of their automatic thoughts and reactions to stressors. At the same time, mindfulness practices can strengthen System 2 processes by encouraging students to engage in deliberate, intentional reflection on their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

Another example is the use of decision-making frameworks that explicitly integrate System 1 and System 2 processes. For example, the Decision-Making Triangle model[^5] encourages individuals to consider their emotions, thoughts, and values when making decisions. This model involves both automatic (System 1) and reflective (System 2) processes, and can be a useful tool for teaching students how to make more intentional, values-driven decisions.

## Benefits of Incorporating Dual-Process Theories into Social Emotional Learning

Incorporating dual-process theories into SEL can have several benefits. First, it can help students develop a more nuanced understanding of their own thinking processes, which can enhance their self-awareness and metacognitive skills[^6]. Second, it can help students develop more effective strategies for managing their emotions and regulating their behavior, by teaching them to balance automatic and reflective processes[^7]. Finally, it can help students become more intentional and values-driven decision-makers, by providing them with a framework for integrating System 1 and System 2 processes[^8].

I have just received a message from Madison and with her permission I am posting it below. Madison took General Chemistry I (lecture) in Autumn 2019 and General Chemistry II (lecture and lab) in Winter 2020.

> Hi Dr. Kahveci,

> I just wanted to say thank you for being an awesome chemistry teacher the past 2 classes. You truly are amazing and one of the best. I had to take chemistry 2 times and you truly helped me feel like I could do my best. I just wanted to say youâ€™re amazing at your job and made a huge impact on my college course. I hope you have a wonderful break and get through all the craziness of this next quarter.

## Introduction

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) has long been my main typesetting environment. This post has some handy dandy codes that I daily use.

## Compression of Existing PDFs

Typical output as a result of LaTeX compilations is in PDF format. PDF is perfect for cross-platform usability. LaTeX don't compress images in the PDF outputs. Thus, depending on the number of images and their sizes, one might get a large PDF file. 

A common approach is the let [`Ghostscript`](https://www.ghostscript.com) (`gs`) optimize and compress the PDF after its generation with `pdflatex`.

The following `command` can be invoked on a LINUX like machine. It takes `foo.pdf` and saves its compressed version as `compressed.pdf` with the parameters specified. I mostly use these settings[^1] for Beamer presentations for about 70% reductions in file sizes without any noticiable loss of quality on screen views. 

[^1]: `-dPrinted=false` preserves the cross-references.

```bash
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.5 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dPrinted=false -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=compressed.pdf foo.pdf
```

## Batch Resize Images

Overly large image files can significantly prolong the compilation process. The following command will raster images with a `.jpg` extension to 600 px width or height in a folder. This gives a decent image quality for Beamer presentations, while making the PDF files significantly smaller.

```bash
sips -Z 600 *.jpg
```
[`Automator`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automator/) on Mac OS can be used to make and run this command as a program with decent GUI interaction but I like `Terminal` as the whole process is much simpler. 

Automator is based on [AppleScript Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptLangGuide/introduction/ASLR_intro.html) however many daily tasks can be done easily without any coding. I thought it might be useful to mention Automator here for more complex manipulations.

Photographic images saved as `.png` can also result in very large file sizes: `.jpg` is usually a much more space-efficient format for photographs. Line drawings, plots and diagrams are better saved as `.png` or `.pdf`, in general. `.pdf` images can also compile faster compared to `.png` files if their file sizes are comparable, as the compile process then doesn't need to call `libpng`[^2].

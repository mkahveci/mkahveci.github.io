## Introduction

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) has long been my main typesetting environment. This post has some handy dandy codes that I daily use.

## Compression 

Typical output as a result of LaTeX compilations is in PDF format. PDF is perfect for cross-platform usability. LaTeX don't compress images in the PDF outputs. Thus, depending on the number of images and their sizes, one might get a large PDF file. 

A common approach is the let [`Ghostscript`](https://www.ghostscript.com) (`gs`) optimize and compress the PDF after its generation with `pdflatex`.

The following `command` can be invoked on a LINUX like machine. It takes `foo.pdf` and saves its compressed version as `compressed.pdf` with the parameters specified. I mostly use these settings[^1] for Beamer presentations for about 70% reductions in file sizes without any noticiable loss of quality on screen views. 

[^1]: `-dPrinted=false` preserves the cross-references.

```bash
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.5 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dPrinted=false -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=compressed.pdf foo.pdf
```

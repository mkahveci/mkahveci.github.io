Welcome to your new Learning Target Tracker! This Google Sheet is designed to help you efficiently monitor student progress on a single Learning Target that is composed of up to five specific Success Criteria.

### Overview
The system is built around a single, reusable template file. For each new Learning Target you assess, you will make a copy of this template. It uses an anonymous **Student ID** system to protect privacy, automates all reporting, and is designed for fast, error-proof data entry on your computer or phone.

## Getting Started: Your Own Copy

If you want to access the view-only master template, please contact [Dr. Kahveci](/contact). Once you receive the link, you must create your own private copy to use it with your own students. Go to the menu and select `File > Make a copy`. This will save a fully editable version to your personal Google Drive. Kindly refrain from using the `Request edit access` button.

## 1. Creating a New Tracker for a Learning Target

Follow these steps each time you begin a new LT.

### Step 1.1: Copy the Template
* In your Google Drive, find your template file named `[TEMPLATE] LT Tracker (5-SC)`.
* Right-click on it and select **Make a copy**.
* Rename the new file with a clear, specific name (e.g., "LT1 Tracker - Chemical Reactions").

### Step 1.2: Populate the Roster
* Open your newly created file.
* Go to the **`Roster_Key`** tab.
* Paste in your complete and current class list. Ensure every student has a **`Student Name`**, a unique and anonymous **`Student ID`**, and a **`Class Section`**.

### Step 1.3: Define the Success Criteria
* Go to the **`SC-1_Entry`** tab. In cell **A1**, replace the placeholder (`SC-01`) with your actual Success Criterion ID for this LT (e.g., `LT1-SC1`).
* Repeat this for the other four tabs (`SC-2_Entry`, `SC-3_Entry`, etc.), giving each its unique ID in cell A1. This is crucial for the dashboard to label your data correctly.

## 2. Daily Data Entry (Mobile-Friendly) ðŸ“±

This is your day-to-day workflow. It's designed to be fast and to ensure no student is missed.

1.  To grade a specific skill, navigate to the correct tab (e.g., you're assessing the second skill, so you go to the **`SC-2_Entry`** tab).
2.  The sheet will present you with a full list of your students.
3.  Find the student you are assessing and go to the **`Performance Level`** column.
4.  Click the cell and select the appropriate level from the simple dropdown menu.
5.  That's it! The data is saved, and your dashboard is instantly updated.

## 3. Analyzing the Results (The Dashboard) ðŸ“ˆ

The **`Dashboard`** tab automatically aggregates and visualizes all the data you enter. You never need to type anything here.

* **The Progress Matrix:** This central grid shows the most recent grade for every student on every Success Criterion. It's color-coded so you can see patterns of understanding at a glance.
* **The `LT Status` Column:** Located right next to the student names, this column automatically tells you if a student has met the Learning Target, based on the 80% rule we set up.
* **The Charts:** The charts provide at-a-glance visuals of the overall class performance, the difficulty of each SC, and a comparison between your class sections.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **What if my LT has fewer than 5 SCs?**
  * Simply hide the unused `SC-X_Entry` tabs. Right-click the tab at the bottom and select **Hide sheet**. The formulas are designed to ignore empty sheets, so it will not cause any errors.

* **What if my LT has *more* than 5 SCs?**
  * You can duplicate an existing `SC-X_Entry` tab and rename it. Then, you must update the formula in the `Data_Aggregate` sheet to include a new `QUERY` line that points to your new tab.

* **How do I add a new student mid-year?**
  * Just add their information to the bottom of the list in the **`Roster_Key`** tab. The student lists on your `SC-X_Entry` tabs and the `Dashboard` will update automatically to include them.

excerpt: "A user guide for the LT Tracker (5-SC), a Google Sheet template for educators to monitor student progress on learning targets using a data-driven, mobile-friendly system."
---

Welcome to your new Learning Target Tracker! This Google Sheet is designed to help you efficiently monitor student progress on a single Learning Target that is composed of up to five specific Success Criteria.

### Overview
This system is built around a single, reusable template file that you can copy for each new Learning Target. It features automated reporting and is designed for fast, error-proof data entry on both desktop and mobile devices. For student privacy, the tracker is designed to work with either student names or anonymous `Student ID`s. Simply choose which identifier to use in your data entry and dashboard tabs to generate either standard or confidential reports.

## Getting Started: Your Own Copy

If you want to access the view-only master template, please contact Dr. Kahveci. Once you receive the link, you must create your own private copy to use it with your own students. Go to the menu and select `File > Make a copy`. This will save a fully editable version to your personal Google Drive. Kindly refrain from using the 'Request edit access' button.

## 1. Creating a New Tracker for a Learning Target

Follow these steps each time you begin a new LT.

### Step 1.1: Copy the Template
* In your Google Drive, find your template file named `[TEMPLATE] LT Tracker (5-SC)`.
* Right-click on it and select **Make a copy**.
* Rename the new file with a clear, specific name (e.g., "LT1 Tracker - Chemical Reactions").

### Step 1.2: Populate the Roster
* Open your newly created file.
* Go to the **`Roster_Key`** tab.
* Paste in your complete and current class list. Ensure every student has a **`Student Name`**, a unique and anonymous **`Student ID`**, and a **`Class Section`**.

### Step 1.3: Define the Success Criteria
* Go to the **`SC-1_Entry`** tab. In cell **A1**, replace the placeholder (`SC-01`) with your actual Success Criterion ID for this LT (e.g., `LT1-SC1`).
* Repeat this for the other four tabs (`SC-2_Entry`, `SC-3_Entry`, etc.), giving each its unique ID in cell A1. This is crucial for the dashboard to label your data correctly.

## 2. Daily Data Entry (Mobile-Friendly) ðŸ“±

This is your day-to-day workflow. It's designed to be fast and to ensure no student is missed.

1.  To grade a specific skill, navigate to the correct tab (e.g., you're assessing the second skill, so you go to the **`SC-1_Entry`** tab) (Figure 1).
2.  The sheet will present you with a full list of your students.
3.  Find the student you are assessing and go to the **`Performance Level`** column.
4.  Click the cell and select the appropriate level from the simple dropdown menu.
5.  That's it! The data is saved, and your dashboard is instantly updated.

## 3. Analyzing the Results (The Dashboard) ðŸ“ˆ

The **`Dashboard`** tab (Figure 2) automatically aggregates and visualizes all the data you enter. You never need to type anything here.

* **The Progress Matrix:** This central grid shows the most recent grade for every student on every Success Criterion. It's color-coded so you can see patterns of understanding at a glance.
* **The `LT Status` Column:** Located right next to the student names, this column automatically tells you if a student has met the Learning Target, based on the 80% rule we set up.
* **The Charts:** The charts provide at-a-glance visuals of the overall class performance, the difficulty of each SC, and a comparison between your class sections.
* For a detailed guide on how to use these reports to inform your teaching practice, please see the section: [*Using the Dashboard for Data-Driven Instruction*](/jpq).

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* **What if my LT has fewer than 5 SCs?**
  * **Step 1:** Hide the unused `SC-X_Entry` tabs (right-click the tab > **Hide sheet**). This will not cause errors.
  * **Step 2 (Crucial):** On the **`Dashboard`** tab, you must **delete the content** from the unused SC ID header cells (in row 2). For example, if you only have 3 SCs, delete the headers in cells F2 and G2. This is essential for the `LT Status` formula to calculate the percentage correctly.

* **What if my LT has *more* than 5 SCs?**
  * **Step 1:** First, **duplicate** an existing `SC-X_Entry` tab (right-click > **Duplicate**) and rename it (e.g., to `SC-6_Entry`). Remember to also update the SC ID in cell **A1** of this new tab.
  * **Step 2:** Next, you must update the master formula in cell **A1** of the **`Data_Aggregate`** sheet (might be hidden) to include this new tab. For example, to expand from 5 to 6 SCs, you would add the extra line below `IFERROR(QUERY('SC-5_Entry'!A3:C, "SELECT A, C, B WHERE B IS NOT NULL"), {"","",""});`
      ```excel
      =QUERY({
        IFERROR(QUERY('SC-1_Entry'!A3:C, "SELECT A, C, B WHERE B IS NOT NULL"), {"","",""});
        IFERROR(QUERY('SC-2_Entry'!A3:C, "SELECT A, C, B WHERE B IS NOT NULL"), {"","",""});
        IFERROR(QUERY('SC-3_Entry'!A3:C, "SELECT A, C, B WHERE B IS NOT NULL"), {"","",""});
        IFERROR(QUERY('SC-4_Entry'!A3:C, "SELECT A, C, B WHERE B IS NOT NULL"), {"","",""});
        IFERROR(QUERY('SC-5_Entry'!A3:C, "SELECT A, C, B WHERE B IS NOT NULL"), {"","",""});
        IFERROR(QUERY('SC-6_Entry'!A3:C, "SELECT A, C, B WHERE B IS NOT NULL"), {"","",""})
      }, "SELECT * WHERE Col1 IS NOT NULL")
      ```

* **How do I add a new student mid-year?**
  * Just add their information to the bottom of your list in the **`Roster_Key`** tab. The student lists on your `SC-X_Entry` tabs and the `Dashboard` will update automatically.
  * **Important:** On each `SC-X_Entry` tab, ensure you also drag down the helper formula in Column C (`SC_ID_Helper`) (might be hidden) to cover the new students.

* **How do I increase the capacity beyond 75 students?**
  * The template is pre-configured for a set number of students. To add more:
  * **1. Extend Dashboard Formulas:** On the **`Dashboard`** tab, select the last working row of formulas (from the `LT Status` column to the last SC column) and drag the fill handle down to cover your new students.
  * **2. Extend Helper Formulas:** On each `SC-X_Entry` tab, drag down the helper formula in Column C (`SC_ID_Helper`) to cover the new students.

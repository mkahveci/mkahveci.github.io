**Ultra-Dense • Low Sugar • Liver-Aware • Gym-Aligned**

This is not ordinary dessert.

This is a structured, portion-controlled, metabolically conscious chocolate square designed for:

- Post-workout recovery
- Controlled sweetness
- Lower fructose load
- High satiety
- Two-week structured usage

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

- 28 small cubes (2 weeks)
- ~90–110 kcal per cube
- ~3–4g sugar per cube
- Mostly healthy fats + fiber
- Minimal liver burden

---

# 🧪 Ingredients (2-Week Batch)

## Wet Base (Reduced Fructose)

- 1 medium apple
- ½ cup pumpkin puree
- 1 cup unsweetened oat or almond milk

---

## Chocolate Structure

- 8 tbsp (½ cup) unsweetened cacao powder
- 4 tbsp superfine blanched almond flour
- 2 tbsp chia seeds

---

## Fat Creaminess

- 4 tbsp hazelnut butter (100% hazelnuts)

---

## Controlled Sweetness

- 2 tbsp honey (total for entire batch)

---

## Flavor Layer

- 1 tsp Ceylon cinnamon
- Pinch sea salt
- Tiny pinch black pepper
- Optional: ½ tsp espresso powder

---

# 🔥 Method

## Step 1 — Reduce the Base

1. Blend apple + pumpkin + milk until smooth.
2. Pour into saucepan.
3. Simmer on low heat for 10–12 minutes.
4. Stir continuously.

Goal:  
Thick pudding consistency before adding dry ingredients.

---

## Step 2 — Build Structure

Whisk in:

- Cacao powder
- Almond flour
- Chia seeds
- Hazelnut butter
- Honey
- Cinnamon
- Sea salt
- Black pepper

Stir on low heat until:

- Mixture pulls away from pan
- Texture becomes glossy
- Spoon feels resistance

If too soft → add 1 tbsp extra cacao.

## Step 3 — Set

1. Line an 8×8 tray with parchment.
2. Press mixture firmly and evenly.
3. Refrigerate for 3 hours.
4. Cut into 28 small squares.

# ❄️ Storage Protocol (Important)

To maintain discipline:

- Keep 7 cubes in refrigerator (week 1 supply).
- Freeze remaining 21 cubes immediately.
- Remove from freezer night before use.

This reduces overexposure and impulse eating.

# 📊 Estimated Nutrition (Per Cube)

Approximate values:

- 95–110 kcal
- 3–4g sugar
- 7–8g fat
- ~2g fiber

Much lower glycemic load than traditional fudge.

---

# 🏋️ Usage Protocol

Consume:

- Within 45 minutes after strength training
- Maximum 1–2 cubes
- Not on rest days
- Not late at night

This is structured indulgence — not free access dessert.

# 🔬 Optional Lower-Sugar Variation

Replace:

- 2 tbsp honey

With:

- 1 tbsp honey
- A few drops liquid stevia

This reduces sugar per cube by ~30–40%.

---

# 🧠 Why This Works

- Almond flour → healthy fats + structure
- Chia → fiber + binding
- Cacao → polyphenols + deep flavor
- Cinnamon → enhances sweetness perception
- Black pepper → improves polyphenol absorption
- Hazelnut butter → smooth mouthfeel without added sugar

This is performance-aligned chocolate — engineered, not improvised.

**Structured. Measured. Sustainable.**

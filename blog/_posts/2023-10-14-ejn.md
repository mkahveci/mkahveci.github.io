If you're looking for a challenging and effective way to train your core, you might want to try this exercise that I call Vertical Leg Raise on Pull-Up Bar with Leg Crunch. It's a combination of two movements that target your abs from different angles and require a lot of stability and strength.

To perform this exercise, you need a pull-up bar that is high enough for you to hang from without touching the ground. You also need to have a good grip and enough upper body strength to support your body weight. Start by hanging from the bar with your arms fully extended and your legs straight. Then, lift your legs up until they are perpendicular to the floor. This is the vertical leg raise part of the exercise. Next, bend your knees and bring them towards your chest as you crunch your abs. This is the leg crunch part of the exercise. Finally, extend your legs back to the vertical position and lower them down to the starting position. Repeat as many times as you can. 

This exercise works your entire core, especially your lower abs, obliques, and hip flexors. It also improves your spinal mobility, balance, and coordination. And it's not easy on your upper body either, as you have to maintain a strong grip and shoulder stability.

This exercise is not for beginners or people with low back pain or shoulder injuries. It requires a lot of core strength and stability, as well as upper body strength and mobility. If you're not ready for it, you can start with simpler variations, such as hanging knee raises, hanging leg raises, or hanging windshield wipers.

Vertical Leg Raise on Pull-Up Bar with Leg Crunch is a great way to challenge yourself and take your core training to the next level. Give it a try and let me know how it goes!

An alternative is vertical twisted leg crunches.

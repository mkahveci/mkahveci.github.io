excerpt: Reflecting on our Thanksgiving break in Cancún, the thrill of high-speed
  physics on the water, and the importance of disconnecting.
---

Academic life is often a marathon of grants, grading, and research. We frequently talk about "velocity" in our work, but we rarely stop to appreciate it in a physical sense.

This Thanksgiving, I decided to trade the classroom for the Caribbean Sea. My daughter, Asel Müge, and I traveled to **Cancún, Mexico** for a much-needed week of disconnection and discovery.

### From Planning to Reality
The trip actually "started" back in October, during a coffee shop strategy session in Chicago. We sat down, mapped out dates, and decided that this Thanksgiving would be different—no grading papers, just sun and sea.

Looking back at that planning photo now, I am grateful we made the commitment. The hospitality here in Mexico has been warm and welcoming, and the weather has been a perfect reprieve from the Chicago chill.

### The Physics of Fun
Yesterday, we visited Aquaworld for what I assumed would be a leisurely boat tour. It turned into a practical lesson in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics.

We took the **Waveriders** (jetskis) out onto the open ocean. Asel was fearless, pushing her machine to nearly 75 mph. I found myself testing the boundaries of the machine's handling—feeling how the hull cut through the water during sharp turns. It was a visceral reminder that sometimes, you need a rush of adrenaline to clear your mind.

### The Importance of the Break
Trips like this are about more than just sightseeing. They are about:
1.  **Bonding:** Quality time with Asel is precious as she grows older.
2.  **Perspective:** Stepping away from the daily grind allows for new ideas to form.
3.  **Gratitude:** Appreciating the ability to travel and experience new cultures.

We return to Chicago soon, but we return recharged.

excerpt: "How do AI tools affect academic integrity? A team of researchers from different disciplines and institutions explores this question in their paper, “Artificial Intelligence and Academic Integrity: Legislate or Educate?”. They use a participatory action research approach and involve various university stakeholders in data collection and analysis. They also suggest ways to promote ethical and appropriate use of information and to improve academic integrity policies and practices in the age of AI."

I am excited to share that our paper, "[Artificial Intelligence and Academic Integrity: Legislate or Educate?](/snu)", has been accepted for presentation at the [PUPP International Summit](https://pupp.uqo.ca/en/gatineau-2024-conference/), which will take place in Gatineau-Ottawa, Canada, from May 21 to 24, 2024. This paper is the result of a collaborative effort among six researchers from different disciplines at Loyola University Chicago.

In this paper, we explore the impact of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, on academic integrity in a U.S. college. We use a participatory action research approach and involve various university stakeholders, such as students, faculty, librarians, and administrators, in data collection and analysis. We aim to understand how AI tools are used for teaching and learning purposes, what benefits and challenges they bring, and how they affect the ethical and appropriate use of information. We also examine the current policies and practices of academic integrity in the context of AI development and suggest ways to improve them.

We adopt a critical media/information literacy perspective and argue that academic integrity is not only a matter of rules and regulations, but also a matter of education and empowerment. We propose that generative AI tools can be used as an opportunity to enhance students' critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration skills, as well as their awareness of ethical issues and social responsibility. We also highlight the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration among all stakeholders to foster a culture of academic integrity that embraces innovation and diversity.

We look forward to presenting our paper at the PUPP International Summit and engaging with other researchers and practitioners who are interested in this topic. We hope that our paper will contribute to the literature on academic integrity in the age of AI and spark further discussion and action.

As a teacher-scholar, the pursuit of better instructional methods never truly ends. Whether I am analyzing large-scale educational data or managing a high school chemistry lab, my goal remains the same: to create a learning environment that is inclusive, engaging, and ethically grounded.

I am thrilled to announce two recent achievements that will directly support this mission in my classroom at Chicago Public Schools during the upcoming academic year.

## 1. Advancing Humane Science with the BioLEAP Grant
   I am honored to be a recipient of the 2025-2026 BioLEAP Classroom Grant, awarded by the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS).

This grant, valued at $1,000, is specifically designed to support humane science education efforts. In the sciences, particularly in biology and anatomy, it is vital that we teach students not just the mechanics of life, but respect for it.

With these funds, I will be acquiring high-quality anatomy resources that allow students to explore complex biological systems without the need for traditional animal dissection. This project aligns perfectly with my teaching philosophy of using modern, student-centered tools to bridge cognitive learning with ethical reasoning. I look forward to sharing photos and updates as we implement these materials in the 2025/2026 school year.

## 2. Deepening Engagement with the Kagan Winter Academy Scholarship
   In addition to new materials, I am excited to sharpen my pedagogical skills. I have been selected as a Scholarship Winner for the 2026 Kagan Winter Academy.

I will be attending the Kagan Cooperative Learning workshop in Nashville, Tennessee, this coming January. For those unfamiliar with Kagan, their structures are the gold standard for boosting student engagement and managing diverse classrooms through cooperative learning.

The selection committee noted that they were touched by my application story regarding how Kagan structures have previously impacted my life as an educator. I am eager to refresh these skills and bring back new, evidence-based strategies to my department, ensuring that every student—regardless of background—has a voice in the collaborative learning process.

Looking Ahead
These two opportunities represent the two halves of effective teaching: having the right tools (BioLEAP) and the right strategies (Kagan).

I am grateful to both NAVS and Kagan Publishing & Professional Development for their support. 2026 is shaping up to be a transformative year for my students!

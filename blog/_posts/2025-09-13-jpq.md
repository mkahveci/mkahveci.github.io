This guide explains how to interpret the automated dashboard in [LT Tracker (5-SC)](/pab) to make effective, data-driven pedagogical decisions.

## How the `LT Status` is Determined Automatically

The **`LT Status`** column provides a summative judgment on whether a student has mastered the overall Learning Target. It is calculated automatically based on a flexible rule.

The current rule is:
**A student has "‚úÖ Met" the Learning Target if the percentage of their graded Success Criteria marked as `High` or `Expected` is 80% or more.**

The formula automatically performs these steps:
1.  Counts the total number of Success Criteria you've graded for a student.
2.  Counts how many of those grades are `High` or `Expected`.
3.  Calculates the percentage of success based only on the graded work.
4.  Compares that percentage to the 80% threshold and displays the final status.

## Using Your Three Charts for Data-Driven Instruction

Each of the three charts on your dashboard is designed to answer a different, crucial question about student learning.

### 1. The Overall Performance Chart (Pie Chart) ü•ß
This chart gives you the "30,000-foot view" of your class's mastery on the Learning Target as a whole (Figure 1). It aggregates all grades for all students into one simple visual.

**How to Use It for Pedagogical Practice:**
This chart helps you make **big-picture decisions about pacing and summative assessment**. Before moving on or giving a final test, this chart answers:

* **"Is the class ready to move on?"** If the `High` and `Expected` slices dominate the chart, the answer is likely yes.
* **"Do I need to re-teach the whole concept?"** If the `Low` slice is significant, it's a clear signal that a large portion of the class is missing the foundational concept and requires whole-group re-teaching.
* **"How effective was my overall instruction for this LT?"** It serves as a quick grade on your own teaching sequence for this topic.

### 2. The Performance by Success Criterion Chart (Stacked Column Chart) üìä
This is your most powerful **diagnostic tool**. It breaks down the Learning Target and shows you exactly which specific skills (Success Criteria) the class is succeeding with and which they are struggling with (Figure 2).

**How to Use It for Pedagogical Practice:**
This chart drives your **daily lesson planning, formative assessment, and differentiation**. It helps you answer:

* **"What should tomorrow's warm-up or review topic be?"** Look for the SC with the largest "Low" section.
* **"Which students do I need to pull for a small group today?"** If you see that SC-3 was a major struggle, use the data matrix to identify the specific students who scored `Low` on SC-3 and pull them for targeted intervention.
* **"Was my lesson on SC-2 effective?"** If the bar for SC-2 is almost entirely `High` and `Expected`, you know your teaching method for that skill was successful.

### 3. The Performance by Class Section Chart (Stacked Column Chart) üßë‚Äçüè´
This chart compares the performance of your different classes against each other.

**How to Use It for Pedagogical Practice:**
This chart is for **reflective practice and section-specific planning** (Figure 3). It helps you answer:

* **"Did my teaching approach work differently in Period 1 versus Period 3?"** Perhaps an activity was more effective in one class than another, and this data will make that visible.
* **"Do my different classes have different needs?"** The data might show that one section is ready for an extension activity, while another needs a comprehensive review day.
* **"Are there potential equity issues?"** If one section is consistently underperforming, this chart provides the objective data needed to start asking deeper questions about instructional strategies.

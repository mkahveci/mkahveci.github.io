This tutorial demonstrates how to set up a `Submission` folder with commenting capabilities and with as associated rubric for assessment. The rubric will be tied to the `Grades` module so that the rubric-based assessment  is automatically translated to an associated grade.  

### New  Folder in Submissions

* Navigate to `Submissions > New Folder`

* `A`: Give a name to the folder. e.g. Lab 1.
* Select a `Grade Item` from the dropdown list. You can add `New Grade Item`, if needed.
* Click `Add Rubric` button and select a rubric from the list. If you don't see a rubric, you need to [import](/ydt#rubric) one.

* Make sure that `Annotation Tools` is checked. This is very important if you want to open the files submitted (without downloading) and give feedback.  

### Import Rubric 
{: #rubric }

You may import rubrics like any other components in D2L. I will be posting rubrics for SQ20-CHE 133 and SQ20-CHE 135 this quarter. To import a rubric:

* Go to `Course Administration > Import / Export / Copy Components` 
* Select `Search for offering`
    * Type `CHE_135_901_1050` in the search box to import a rubric for `CHE 135`
    * Type `CHE_133_303_1050` in the search box to import a rubric for `CHE 133`

* `Select Components` and then check `Rubrics` to import.
* Wait for copying and done!

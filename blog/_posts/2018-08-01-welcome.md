I made this site to host my work â€”research, publications, and teaching in chemistry education research (CER).  Large projects have a natural home as books and articles  in scientific journals.  However, I'll often spend an afternoon following up on some small ideas, handy dandy tools that are of passing interest to me. I would like to keep a journal of these small ideas. Not planning a blog, but something involving a bit more functional logs.

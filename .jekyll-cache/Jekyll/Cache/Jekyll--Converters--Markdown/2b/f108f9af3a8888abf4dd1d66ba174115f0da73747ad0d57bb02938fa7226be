  <p>Hi Dr. Kahveci,</p>

  <p>I just wanted to say thank you for being an awesome chemistry teacher the past 2 classes. You truly are amazing and one of the best. I had to take chemistry 2 times and you truly helped me feel like I could do my best. I just wanted to say youâ€™re amazing at your job and made a huge impact on my college course. I hope you have a wonderful break and get through all the craziness of this next quarter.</p>

  <p>Sincerely,</p>

  <p>Madison</p>

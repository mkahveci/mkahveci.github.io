<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Determine the general rate law for a chemical reaction by calculating the reaction rate for various concentrations of reactants.
    <ul>
      <li>Using the concentrations listed on the reagent bottles and the volumes in Table 2, calculate the diluted concentrations for each species using</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

\[M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2}\]

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the reaction rate for each trial using the diluted concentration of thiosulfate and the time (in seconds) it took for the blue complex to appear, using</li>
</ul>

\[\text{rate} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{[S_2O_3^{2-}]_i}{\Delta t}\]

<ul>
  <li>The partial order of each reactant will be found by comparing different rates and sets of concentrations to one another, yielding the experimental rate law for this specific reaction.
    <ul>
      <li>Use the method of initial rates and logarithms to calculate the partial order of each reactant for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> set of runs separately. e.g. The ratio of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run 2</code> over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run 1</code> gives:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

\[\frac{\text{rate}_2}{\text{rate}_1}  = \frac{ k [H^{+}]^x_2 [H_2O_2^{+}]^y_2 [I^{-}]^z_2}
    {k [H^{+}]^x_1 [^{+}]^y_1 [I^{-}]^z_1}
    = 
    \Big( \frac{[I^{-}]_2}
    { [I^{-}]_1} \Big)^z\]

<p>where \(z\) can be found by</p>

\[z = \frac{\log \frac{\text{rate}_2}{\text{rate}_1} }{ \log \frac{[I^{-}]_2}
    { [I^{-}]_1} }\]

<ul>
  <li>This process is then repeated until all of the partial orders in the rate law are determined. The average partial orders should be listed to the same number of significant figures as the individual trial partial orders.</li>
  <li>Calculate the rate constant at that temperature using the rate and concentration data from any run</li>
</ul>

\[k = \frac{\text{rate}}{[H^{+}]^x [H_2O_2^{+}]^y [I^{-}]^z }\]

<ul>
  <li>\(k\) value should be calculated for each run, which means 4 runs \(\times\) 2 trials \(= 8\) different \(k\) values are calculated.</li>
  <li>Report average \(k\) constant \(\pm\) standard deviation, following the rules for significant figures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Watch demo video for the experiment</li>
  <li>Download the data set and do the data analysis</li>
  <li>You must upload a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PDF</code> file of <strong>partial lab report</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>This is a deviation for the summer session only</li>
      <li>Include the following sections: Abstract, Procedures, Results, Data Table, Experimental Rate Law, and Discussion (not a full discussion section; just itemize and answer the questions.)</li>
      <li>You don’t need to include sample calculations in the <strong>partial report</strong> (it is in Excel only), don’t need to write narrative explaining data tables and calculations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You must upload all calculations and data tables in an MS Excel file 
\item You should review the Lab Report Guidelines, Sample General Chemistry Lab Report, and Appendix E on D2L while writing to ensure that your drafts are correctly formatted.</li>
</ul>

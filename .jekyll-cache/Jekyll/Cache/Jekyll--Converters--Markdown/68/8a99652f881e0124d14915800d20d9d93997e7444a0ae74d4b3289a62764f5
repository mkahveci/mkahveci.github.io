</ul>

<h2 id="qas">Q&amp;As</h2>

<h3 id="the-area-values-for-the-pure-substances">The area values for the pure substances</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I noticed that we did not have the area (pA.s) values for the pure substances. This value is necessary in order to begin calculations on the rest of the data. I have watched the lab introduction videos as well as your excel tutorial but I could not find this information and am hoping for some guidance to point me in the right direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These values can be extracted from the Liquid data (the first table) and Gas data (the second table) separately. So, we will read this information as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When Part A equals to 1.0, it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pure pentane</code>. Pure pentane has both liquid and gas phases.
    <ul>
      <li>Liquid area: $ 5.10 \times 10^4 ~\text{pA.s} $</li>
      <li>Gas area: $ 6.19 \times 10^4 ~\text{pA.s} $</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When Part A equals to 0.0, it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pure hexane</code>. Pure hexane has both liquid and gas phases.
    <ul>
      <li>Liquid area: $ 6.57 \times 10^4 ~\text{pA.s} $</li>
      <li>Gas area: $ 2.82 \times 10^4 ~\text{pA.s} $</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="prepostlab-quizzes">Pre/postlab quizzes</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just completed the post lab quiz for lab 1 but it doesn’t let me see which questions I answered incorrectly. Is there any way you can turn this setting on?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was just wondering how I can check what 2 answers I got wrong?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These quizzes are set for unlimited attempts because 70% or higher is needed to continue the next steps. Therefore, the feedback functionality is limited on them. You would not see which questions were answered incorrectly in a previous attempt.</p>

<h3 id="access-to-the-datasets">Access to the datasets</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have completed to pre-lab, post-lab, and lab videos for Lab 1. Can I have access to the data now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the completion of postlab quiz with 70% or higher grade, you are allowed to download the data sets assigned to you. You may need to refresh your browser to enable the hyperlink for <a href="https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757299/View">Experiment 1 Raoult’s Law Data</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-for-the-worksheet">The data for the worksheet</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>What data do I use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The worksheet should be completed by using the <a href="https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757299/View">Experiment 1 Raoult’s Law Data</a> dataset. This data set belongs to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hexane</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heptane</code> mixture.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-for-the-excel-file">The data for the Excel file</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>What data do I use?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to the <a href="https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757287/View">rubric</a> and unlike the worksheet, your Excel file should include the analyses of both data sets:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DCM</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">acetone</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pentane</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hexane</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You will need to choose and report one of the data sets in the worksheet. Please make sure that you indicate which data set you chose by marking the appropriate checkbox in the worksheet.</p>

<p><a href="https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757294/View">Experiment 1 Raoult’s Law Students</a> dataset is for only practice. This data set is used for instructional video. Students should download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DCM</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">acetone</code> data and do the analysis while watching the video for the Excel workshop: <a href="https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757297/View">Experiment 1 Raoult’s Law Excel Workshop</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-worksheet">The worksheet</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the assignment only a worksheet, no lab report?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. This experiment has only worksheet. You do not write a lab report.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-online-version-of-ms-office-and-a-chromebook">Using the online version of MS Office and a Chromebook</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was wondering if you could assist me with making the graphs for Experiment 1… This is a very short video the issue I am running into.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Watching the video, I see that you are using the online version of MS Office and a Chromebook. I have not tested Chromebook specifically but I am quite positive that you need a regular computer to complete this course assignments. Even an old laptop/desktop maybe more powerful than a Chromebook. You should download and install a copy of MS Office on your computer in order to fully follow my instructions to make graphs and calculations in Excel. Here is the <a href="https://offices.depaul.edu/information-services/services/Software/Pages/Software-for-Personal-Computers.aspx">link</a> for students to obtain a free MS Office copy.</p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<h3 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pentane and hexane can be considered dipole-dipole due to the both being dipolar molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please do your research more carefully. How do you determine the polarity of a compound?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Raoult’s Law Plot is made with trendlines (linear fit function).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not correct. This plot has hypothetical diagonal lines in order to observe deviations from the ideal behavior.</p>

<h3 id="formatting-issues">Formatting issues</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Figures have gridlines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We require no gridlines on the figures. Please review the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lab Report Guidelines</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sample General Chemistry Lab Report</code>.</p>

<h3 id="issues-in-calculations">Issues in calculations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In calculations:
    <ul>
      <li>Formulae are missing</li>
      <li>Values are not properly plugged in with units</li>
      <li>Calculations are not shown step by step until the final result
        <ul>
          <li>i.e. Writing a formula and a value as its final result do not suffice the requirement: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Include all of the seps necessary to obtain the correct value</code>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

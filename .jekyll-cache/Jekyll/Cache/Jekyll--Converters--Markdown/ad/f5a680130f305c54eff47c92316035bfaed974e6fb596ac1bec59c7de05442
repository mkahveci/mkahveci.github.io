<h3 id="calculate-the-molarity-of-standardized-naoh">Calculate the molarity of standardized NaOH</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Find the moles of KHP.</li>
</ul>

\[n_\text{KHP} = \frac{m_\text{pure KHP}}{ 204.2212 ~\text{ g/mol}}\]

<ul>
  <li>Determine the moles of NaOH using the stoichiometric ratio for the reaction.</li>
</ul>

\[n_{\text{NaOH}} = n_\text{KHP} \times  \frac{ 1 ~\text{ mol NaOH}}{ 1 ~\text{mol KHP}}\]

<ul>
  <li>Determine the molarity of NaOH</li>
</ul>

\[M_\text{NaOH} = \frac{ n_{\text{NaOH}}}{ V_{\text{NaOH}}}\]

<p>where \(V_{\text{NaOH}}\) is the volume of NaOH in liters (L) to reach the endpoint.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the average molarity of NaOH and its standard deviation. Use the average concentration value for the subsequent calculations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="calculate-the-mass-of-khp-in-impure-khp">Calculate the mass of KHP in impure KHP</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the moles of base delivered when analyzing the impure KPH sample.</li>
</ul>

\[n_{\text{NaOH}} = V_{NaOH} \times  M_\text{NaOH}\]

<p>where \(V_{\text{NaOH}}\) is the volume of NaOH in liters (L) to reach the endpoint for impure KHP titration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the moles of KHP using the stoichiometric ratio for the reaction.</li>
</ul>

\[n_{\text{KHP}} = n_\text{NaOH} \times  \frac{1 \text{ mol KHP }}{ 1 \text{ mol NaOH }}\]

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the mass of KHP in impure sample.</li>
</ul>

\[m_\text{KHP} =  n_{\text{KHP}} ( 204.2212 \text{ g/mol})\]

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the mass percent of KHP in impure sample.</li>
</ul>

\[\text{mass \% KHP} = \frac{m_\text{KHP}}{ m_\text{impure sample}} \times 100\%\]

<ul>
  <li>Calculate the average mass percent KHP and its standard deviation. Report the unknown number of the sample as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Print out pages 7-11 of the lab manual and respond to all prompts in a clearly written and well-organized manner.</li>

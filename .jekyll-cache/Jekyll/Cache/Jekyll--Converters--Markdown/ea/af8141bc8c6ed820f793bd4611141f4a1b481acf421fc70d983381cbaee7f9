Two-stage stratified sampling strategy provided the sample for the analysis. Findings showed that</p>

<ul>
  <li>boys have significantly higher mathematical self-efficacy, self-concept, motivation and lower mathematics anxiety than girls,</li>
  <li>students with higher socioeconomic status have higher self-efficacy, self-concept and motivation whereas students with the highest mathematics anxiety are in medium socioeconomic level, and</li>
  <li>self-efficacy, self-concept, motivation and anxiety differ significantly with respect to geographical regions.</li>

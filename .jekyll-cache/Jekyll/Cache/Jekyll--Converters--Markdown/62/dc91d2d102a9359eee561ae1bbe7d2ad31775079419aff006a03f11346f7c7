<p>Please note that this page includes only joint projects with the kahveci group. Ajda Kahveciâ€™s
    webpage would probably have the complete list of projects.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong>. <a href="/dgq">Pedagogical discontentment and self-efficacy of science teachers</a> (2013 - 2015)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Science Teachersâ€™ Pedagogical Discontentment (STPD) scale has formerly been developed in the United States and used since 2006. Based on the perceptions of selected teachers, the scale is deeply rooted in the cultural and national standards.</li>

<h2 id="the-area-values-for-the-pure-substances">The area values for the pure substances</h2>

<p>These values can be extracted from the Liquid data (the first table) and Gas data (the second table) separately. So, we will read this information as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When Part A equals to 1.0, it is <strong>pure pentane</strong>. Pure pentane has both liquid and gas phases.
    <ul>
      <li>Liquid area: $ 5.10 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $</li>
      <li>Gas area: $ 6.19 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When Part A equals to 0.0, it is <strong>pure hexane</strong>. Pure hexane has both liquid and gas phases.
    <ul>
      <li>Liquid area: $ 6.57 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $</li>
      <li>Gas area: $ 2.82 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

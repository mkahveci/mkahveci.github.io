<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Analysis of known solutions
    <ul>
      <li>For this experiment, you will first test a series of known samples, each containing a particular anion, according to the prescribed test for it and record your observations.</li>
      <li>Download the lab notebook from the course web page, and take notes  while watching the lab video recording. So, you will rely on your careful observations and own notes. This page will not be uploaded, it is for self-study only.</li>
      <li>Lab manual has enough details for preparing the sample test solutions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analysis of unknown solutions
    <ul>
      <li>You will then carry out the same analysis for two unknown samples, one from each batch of unknowns (i.e., NA #, NB #).</li>
      <li>Using the figure below, determine the unknown sample.</li>
      <li>Do not forget to note the unknown number in your lab report.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

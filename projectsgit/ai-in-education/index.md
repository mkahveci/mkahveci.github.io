# AI Tools in Education Project

### Abstract
This project pioneers the development and validation of adaptable **AI-driven pedagogical tools** designed to enhance content mastery and academic equity across diverse learning contexts, from **secondary science** to **undergraduate chemistry and research**. It addresses two primary objectives: first, the development of custom generative AI prompts to serve as interactive, Socratic learning assistants for complex STEM concepts; and second, the creation of AI-scaffolded materials to improve accessibility for **English Language Learners (ELLs)**. Drawing upon two decades of experience in university and high school chemistry education, the project demonstrates a scalable framework for designing evidence-based resources that enhance personalized learning and foster global educational advancements.

### Repository Structure

- `README.md`: Contains project details.
- `/docs`: Contains files with examples of custom prompts.

### Custom Prompt Library

This project compiles a curated library of custom prompts addressing specific educational challenges within the high school science classroom and various other subject areas detailed in the `Project Documents`.

### Usage Information

For best results, copy the full "Prompt Text" from the linked Markdown file and paste it into your preferred large language model (LLM), such as Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude.

**1. Copy the Prompt**

**2. Paste into LLM**

The core of the system instruction is usually at the top of the prompt text.

# AI Tools in Education Project

### Abstract
This project pioneers the development and validation of adaptable **AI-driven pedagogical tools** designed to enhance content mastery and academic equity across diverse learning contexts, from **secondary science** to **undergraduate chemistry and research**. It addresses two primary objectives: first, the development of custom generative AI prompts to serve as interactive, Socratic learning assistants for complex STEM concepts; and second, the creation of AI-scaffolded materials to improve accessibility for **English Language Learners (ELLs)**. Drawing upon two decades of experience in university and high school chemistry education, the project demonstrates a scalable framework for designing evidence-based resources that enhance personalized learning and foster global educational advancements.

### Repository Structure

- `README.md`: Contains project details.
- `/data`: Contains files with examples of custom prompts.

### Custom Prompt Library

This project includes a curated library of custom prompts designed for specific educational challenges in the high school science classroom, particularly Chemistry and ELL support.

| **Prompt Title**                  | **Focus Area** | **Description** | **Link**                                                                        | 
 |-----------------------------------| ----- | ----- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Socratic Chemistry Tutor**      | Stoichiometry | Guides students through complex calculations step-by-step using only guiding questions. | [View Prompt](/projectsgit/ai-in-education/docs/socratic_chemistry_tutor)                  | 
| **ELL Text Simplifier  & Vocabulary Scaffolder**          | Vocabulary / Reading | Takes a dense scientific paragraph and outputs a simplified version with a target vocabulary list. | [View Prompt](/projectsgit/ai-in-education/docs/ell_text_simplifier)  | 
| **Reaction Mechanism Explainer**  | Organic Chemistry | Acts as a visual aid describer, explaining reaction steps in accessible language. | [View Prompt](https://www.google.com/search?q=_prompts/reaction_mechanism.html)   | 
| **Balancing Equation Scaffolder** | General Chemistry | Breaks down the steps for balancing complex equations, asking the user to confirm each step. | [View Prompt](https://www.google.com/search?q=_prompts/balancing_scaffolder.html) |

### Usage Information

For best results, copy the full "Prompt Text" from the linked Markdown file and paste it into your preferred large language model (LLM), such as Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude.

**1. Copy the Prompt**

**2. Paste into LLM**

The core of the system instruction is usually at the top of the prompt text.

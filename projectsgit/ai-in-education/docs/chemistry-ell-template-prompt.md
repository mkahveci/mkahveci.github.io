## Chemistry ELL Content Modification Template

This template helps you modify chemistry content, such as problem sets, diagrams, and lab procedures, for English Language Learners (ELLs) based on the **REACH proficiency scale**. It focuses on making abstract principles and mathematical concepts accessible.

## Chemistry ELL Content Modification Template

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | I am a high school chemistry teacher at Chicago Public Schools. |
| **Content Area** | Chemistry |
| **Grade Level(s)** | 10th grade |
| **Learning Target** | Students will be able to balance chemical equations and identify reaction types. |
| **Success Criteria** | Students can accurately balance 5 out of 7 chemical equations and correctly classify them as synthesis, decomposition, single displacement, or double displacement reactions. |
| **Input Content (Original Question)** | "What is the law of conservation of mass and how does it relate to balancing chemical equations?" |
| **Modification Task** | Generate modified versions of the input content to support English Language Learners (ELLs) at different proficiency levels. |
| **Modification Focus** | Simplify vocabulary and syntax, use analogies and visuals, and provide clear definitions for scientific laws and processes. |

## Modified Content for ELL Proficiency Levels (REACH Scale)

### Level 1 (Entering)

The goal is to use **simple, high-frequency words** and focus on **concrete, visual concepts**.

**Modified Question:**
The **Law of Conservation of Mass** is a rule: The **mass** (weight) you start with must be the same as the mass you end with. 

1.  What is the main idea of this rule?
2.  Why do we need to make the **atoms** on the left side of a chemical equation the **same** as the atoms on the right side? (We must balance the atoms.)

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Visual Aids:** Use a visual of a simple chemical reaction (e.g., Lego bricks) where the total number of blocks does not change, only the arrangement.
* **Sentence Frame:** "The law means the total amount of ________ doesn't change."

***

### Level 2 (Beginning)

The goal is to use **short, simple sentences** and **repeat key concepts** with a **word bank**.

**Modified Question:**
The **Law of Conservation of Mass** says: You cannot create new matter, and you cannot destroy matter. The total amount of **mass** must be the same before and after a chemical reaction.

1.  Look at the word bank. What does the **Law of Conservation of Mass** tell us about matter?
2.  How does this law connect to **balancing chemical equations**? (Hint: Atoms are matter.) We must count the atoms on both sides and make sure the numbers are equal.

**Word Bank:**
| Term | Simple Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mass** | The amount of 'stuff' (weight). |
| **Conservation** | To save or keep the same. |
| **Matter** | Everything around us (atoms). |
| **Reaction** | When chemicals mix and change. |

***

### Level 3 (Developing)

The goal is to introduce **some academic vocabulary**, use **analogies**, and begin **combining ideas** in more complex structures.

**Modified Question:**
The **Law of Conservation of Mass** states that **matter** can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Think of it like a **recipe**: you start with a certain mass of ingredients (**reactants**), and you must end with the same total mass in the final dish (**products**).

1.  Explain the Law of Conservation of Mass using your own words or the 'recipe' analogy.
2.  How does this scientific law necessitate (make necessary) the process of **balancing chemical equations**?

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Glossary:** Provide formal definitions for *reactant* and *product*.
* **Sentence Starter:** "This law is related to balancing equations because the equation must show that the total number of atoms of each element is ________ on both sides."

***

### Level 4 (Expanding)

The goal is to use **grade-level academic vocabulary**, modify the sentence structure for **directness**, and offer **scaffolded support** for the relationship between the concepts.

**Modified Question:**
Analyze the **Law of Conservation of Mass** and articulate its direct relationship to the procedure of **balancing chemical equations**. Your explanation should clarify why the total number of atoms for each element must remain **equivalent** on both the **reactant** and **product** sides of the equation.

**Scaffolding Focus (Graphic Organizer Idea):**

| Concept | Definition | Connection to Balancing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Law of Conservation of Mass** | (State the law) | |
| **Chemical Equation** | Shows the rearrangement of atoms | |
| **Balancing** | (Explain the process) | |

***

### Level 5 (Bridging)

The goal is to use **grade-level academic language** with minimal modification, focusing on **clarifying abstract concepts** and **significance**.

**Modified Question:**
Explain the **Law of Conservation of Mass** and discuss its **fundamental significance** in the process of **stoichiometry** and the accurate **representation** of chemical reactions through balanced equations.

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Focus on Significance:** Prompt students to discuss the implications of the law beyond just the mechanics of counting atoms (e.g., its role in predicting product yield or conducting quantitative analysis).
* **Vocabulary Check:** Ensure students understand high-level terms like *stoichiometry, fundamental, representation, and quantitative*.

***

### Level 6 (Reaching)

**Modified Prompt:**
**Original Question:** "What is the law of conservation of mass and how does it relate to balancing chemical equations?"

**Focus:** Minimal to no modification needed. The content is presented in its original form, focusing on **advanced scientific reasoning**. Students should be ready to independently synthesize the definition, the requirement for balancing, and the mathematical implications of the law.

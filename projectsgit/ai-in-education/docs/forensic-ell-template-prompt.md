## Forensic Science ELL Content Modification Template

This template helps you modify forensic science content, such as case studies, lab procedures, and analysis reports, for English Language Learners (ELLs) based on the REACH proficiency scale. It focuses on making technical and procedural information accessible.

# Forensic Science ELL Content Modification Template

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | I am a high school chemistry teacher at Chicago Public Schools. |
| **Content Area** | Forensic Science |
| **Grade Level(s)** | 11th/12th Grade |
| **Learning Target** | Students will be able to analyze and interpret fingerprints to determine a suspect's identity. |

## Modified Content for ELL Proficiency Levels (REACH Scale)

### Level 1 (Entering)

The goal is to use **simple, high-frequency words** and focus on **basic identification** with clear visuals.

**Modified Explanation:**
We looked at the **fingerprint** (finger mark) from the door handle. It was a **hidden print** (**latent print**).
1.  The print has a **circle shape** (a **whorl**).
2.  We saw small, special lines on the print.
    * One line is a **tiny dot** (**island**).
    * One line **splits in two** (**bifurcation**).

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Labeled Diagram:** Provide a large, clear diagram of the three main fingerprint patterns (loop, whorl, arch) with simple labels.
* **Core Vocabulary:** **Fingerprint** (a mark left by a finger), **Door** (thing you open), **Shape** (how it looks).

***

### Level 2 (Beginning)

The goal is to use **short, simple sentences** and provide a **word bank with visuals** for key terms.

**Modified Explanation & Steps:**
The police found a **latent print** (a hidden fingerprint) on the doorknob. We analyzed (studied) the print.

**Results of the Fingerprint Analysis:**
1.  **Pattern Type:** The print had a **whorl** pattern. (A whorl looks like a circle or a spiral.)
2.  **Characteristics (Minutiae):** We found special lines that make the print unique. We saw:
    * A **bifurcation** (one line splits into two).
    * An **island** (a very short, single line).
    * These unique lines were close to the **delta** (a triangle shape).

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Word Bank with Visuals:**
  | Term | Simple Meaning | Visual |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Latent Print** | Hidden fingerprint, not visible. |  |
  | **Whorl** | A fingerprint with a circle/spiral pattern. |  |
  | **Bifurcation** | A single ridge line that divides into two. |  |
  | **Island** | A very short, single ridge line. |  |
* **Sentence Frame:** "The print was a ________ (pattern). This is important because it had ________ (minutiae) which helps us find the suspect."

***

### Level 3 (Developing)

The goal is to introduce **academic vocabulary** with a glossary and use **analogies** to explain concepts.

**Modified Explanation:**
The **analysis** of the **latent print** (the print that was developed and lifted) from the doorknob showed a ridge **pattern** that was **consistent** with a **whorl**. (Think of a fingerprint like a unique **map** of lines and shapes).

To identify the suspect, we looked for **distinguishing characteristics** called **minutiae**. These unique points included:
1.  An **island** (a single, short ridge line).
2.  A **bifurcation** (a ridge that divides).
3.  These points were located near the **delta** (the triangular area of the print).

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Glossary of Academic Terms:**
    * **Latent Print:** A print that is not readily visible to the naked eye.
    * **Consistent:** Matching or agreeing with.
    * **Minutiae:** The specific points or features on the ridges of a fingerprint.
    * **Delta:** A point in a loop or whorl print that looks like a triangle.
* **Analogy:** The **minutiae** are like the **landmarks** on the map; they are the unique features used for navigation (identification).

***

### Level 4 (Expanding)

The goal is to use **grade-level vocabulary** and a **direct sentence structure** with a **graphic organizer** to guide analysis.

**Modified Summary:**
The **forensic analysis** of the **latent print** recovered from the doorknob concluded that the **ridge pattern** was a **whorl**. This print also contained several **distinguishing** **minutiae** that confirm its uniqueness. Specifically, an **island** and a **bifurcation** were observed in proximity to the **delta** region of the print.

**Scaffolding Focus (Lab Report Structure):**

| **Analysis Category** | **Observation** | **Forensic Terminology** | **Significance** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Print Visibility** | Print was not initially visible. | Latent Print | Requires developing/lifting. |
| **Primary Pattern** | The center lines formed concentric circles. | Whorl | Used for broad classification. |
| **Specific Detail 1** | A single line split into two ridges. | Bifurcation | Used for individualization. |
| **Specific Detail 2** | A short, isolated ridge. | Island | Used for individualization. |

***

### Level 5 (Bridging)

The goal is to present **content at or near grade level**, focusing on clarifying **complex concepts** and **legal/technical standards**.

**Modified Explanation:**
The **forensic examination** of the **latent print** recovered from the **crime scene artifact** (the doorknob) **established** a pattern **classification** consistent with a **whorl**. Furthermore, the print exhibited several **distinguishing** **ridge characteristics** (**minutiae**) essential for **individualization**. Notably, an **island** and a **bifurcation** were documented in the **sub-region** surrounding the **delta**, meeting the standard required for detailed comparison.

**Scaffolding Focus:**
* **Legal Context:** Clarify the difference between **classification** (whorl, arch, loop) and **individualization** (matching the minutiae to a single person).
* **Vocabulary:** Review advanced terms like *artifact, established, sub-region, individualization*.
* **Implied meaning:** Discuss why these specific minutiae were mentionedâ€”they are the points used for court testimony.

### Level 6 (Reaching)

**Modified Prompt:**
**Original Input:** "Analysis of the latent print lifted from the doorknob revealed a pattern consistent with a whorl, with several distinguishing characteristics including an island and a bifurcation near the delta."

**Focus:** Minimal to no modification needed. The content is presented in its original form, focusing on **advanced scientific and legal reasoning**. Students should be ready to discuss the **ACDV** (Analysis, Comparison, Evaluation, Verification) method and the **minimum number of minutiae** required for a positive identification in various jurisdictions.

## Modified Content for ELL Proficiency Levels (REACH Scale)

### 1. Level 1 (Entering)

The goal is to use **simple, high-frequency words** and present the problem using only the **variables and numbers**.

**Modified Problem:**
We **push** a **box** with a **force** ($\text{F}$) of 100 N. The box has a **mass** ($\text{m}$) of 25 kg.
**Find**: $\text{a}$ (acceleration). 

**Equation:** $\text{F} = \text{m} \times \text{a}$

**Question:** What is the **acceleration** ($\text{a}$)?

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Visual Aid:** A simple drawing showing the force arrow, the box, and the direction of acceleration.
* **Vocabulary:**
    * **Force (F):** A push or pull.
    * **Mass (m):** How much 'stuff' is in the box (weight).
    * **Acceleration (a):** How fast the box speeds up.

***

### 2. Level 2 (Beginning)

The goal is to use **short, simple sentences** and provide **step-by-step procedure** with a word bank.

**Modified Problem:**
A box has a **mass** of 25 kg. We put a **force** of 100 N on the box. The box starts to speed up.
**Calculate** (find the answer for) the **acceleration** of the box.

**Steps to Solve ($\text{F} = \text{m} \times \text{a}$):**
1.  **Write** the numbers you know: $\text{F} =$ \_\_\_\_\_\_ N, $\text{m} =$ \_\_\_\_\_\_ kg.
2.  **Write** the equation: $\text{F} = \text{m} \times \text{a}$.
3.  **Change** the equation to find $\text{a}$: $\text{a} = \text{F} \div \text{m}$.
4.  **Solve**: $\text{a} = \_\_\_\_\_\_ \div \_\_\_\_\_\_ = \_\_\_\_\_\_ \text{ m/s}^2$.

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Word Bank:** Force (N), Mass (kg), Acceleration ($\text{m}/\text{s}^2$), Calculate, Equation.
* **Color-Coding:** Highlight the word **Force** in the problem and the variable **F** in the equation with the same color.

***

### 3. Level 3 (Developing)

The goal is to introduce **some academic vocabulary** and **guide students to identify the known and unknown variables**.

**Modified Problem:**
Using **Newton's Second Law** ($\text{F}=\text{ma}$), determine the **acceleration** of an **object** given the following conditions:
* A **net force** of 100 Newtons ($\text{N}$) is applied.
* The object's **mass** is 25 kilograms ($\text{kg}$).

**Guide to Solving:**
1.  **Known Variables:** (What information is given?)
    * $\text{F} = $ \_\_\_\_\_\_
    * $\text{m} = $ \_\_\_\_\_\_
2.  **Unknown Variable:** (What do you need to find?)
    * $\text{a} = $ ?
3.  **Solve for 'a'**: Rearrange the equation $\text{F} = \text{ma}$ to solve for acceleration.

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Analogy:** **Force** is like the engine of a car; **mass** is like the car's weight; **acceleration** is the car's speed change.
* **Glossary:** **Object** (a thing), **Applied** (put on or used), **Determine** (find out).

***

### 4. Level 4 (Expanding)

The goal is to use **grade-level academic vocabulary** and provide a **graphic organizer** to formalize the problem-solving process.

**Modified Problem:**
An **external net force** of 100 Newtons is **exerted** on a 25-kilogram object. **Calculate** the resulting **rate of acceleration** in $\text{meters}/\text{second}^2$.

**Scaffolded Problem-Solving Organizer:**

| **Step** | **Procedure** | **Variable/Value** | **Equation Used** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. **Identify** | State the known $\text{F}$ and $\text{m}$. | $\text{F} = $ \_\_\_\_\_\_ $\text{N}$ $\text{m} = $ \_\_\_\_\_\_ $\text{kg}$ | $\text{F} = \text{ma}$ |
| 2. **Rearrange** | Isolate the unknown variable ($\text{a}$). | $\text{a} = $ \_\_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_ |
| 3. **Substitute** | Insert numerical values. | $\text{a} = $ \_\_\_\_\_\_ / \_\_\_\_\_\_ | |
| 4. **Calculate** | Solve and include the correct units. | $\text{a} = $ \_\_\_\_\_\_ $\text{m}/\text{s}^2$ | |

***

### 5. Level 5 (Bridging)

The goal is to present **content at or near the target proficiency level**, focusing on **complex phrasing** and **conceptual clarity**.

**Modified Problem:**
Based on the principles of **Newtonian mechanics**, specifically the relationship described by the **Second Law of Motion**, what is the resulting **magnitude** of **acceleration** when a **net external force** of 100 N is **applied** to an object possessing an **inertial mass** of 25 kg?

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Phrasing Clarification:** Review the meaning of terms like *magnitude* (size/amount) and *inertial mass* (mass as resistance to change in motion).
* **Conceptual Check:** Ask students to briefly explain *why* the force and acceleration are directly proportional (if force increases, acceleration increases).

***

### 6. Level 6 (Reaching)

**Modified Prompt:**
**Original Input:** "A force of 100 N is applied to a box with a mass of 25 kg. What is the acceleration of the box?"

**Focus:** Minimal to no modification needed. The content is presented in its original form. Students should be ready to independently solve, show all work, and potentially discuss a related conceptual problem (e.g., "How would the acceleration change if the force were doubled?").

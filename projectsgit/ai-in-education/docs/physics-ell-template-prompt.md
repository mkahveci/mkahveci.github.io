# Physics ELL Content Modification Template
This template helps you modify physics content, such as problem sets, diagrams, and lab procedures, for English Language Learners (ELLs) based on the **REACH proficiency scale**. It focuses on making abstract principles and mathematical concepts accessible.

### **Teacher & Course Details**
* **Role**: I am a high school chemistry teacher at Chicago Public Schools.
* **Content Area**: Physics 
* **Grade Level(s)**: 11th Grade 

### **Lesson & Concept Details**
* **Learning Target**: Students will be able to calculate the force, mass, or acceleration of an object using Newton's Second Law.
* **Success Criteria**: Students can correctly solve 3 out of 4 problems involving Newton's Second Law (F=ma).
* **Input Problem/Text**: Paste the original problem or text you need modified for ELLs.
    * **Example Input**: "A force of 100 N is applied to a box with a mass of 25 kg. What is the acceleration of the box?" 

### **Modification Instructions**
**Task**: Generate modified versions of the input content to support English Language Learners (ELLs) at different proficiency levels.

**Modification Focus**: Simplify the language in word problems, provide a glossary for key terms, and scaffold the problem-solving process with visual aids and explicit steps.

**Levels**: Provide modified content for each of the following proficiency levels based on the **REACH scale**.

1.  **Level 1 (Entering)**: Use simple, high-frequency words. Provide a diagram with labeled variables and a very simple question.
    * *Example*: "Force = 100 N. Mass = 25 kg. Find acceleration." 
2.  **Level 2 (Beginning)**: Use short, simple sentences. Provide a word bank with visuals for key terms like **force**, **mass**, and **acceleration**. Break the problem into a step-by-step procedure.
3.  **Level 3 (Developing)**: Introduce some academic vocabulary with a glossary. Use analogies to explain the concepts (e.g., "Force is like a push or a pull"). Guide students to identify the known and unknown variables in the problem.
4.  **Level 4 (Expanding)**: Use grade-level academic vocabulary. Modify the sentence structure to be more direct. Provide a graphic organizer or a list of steps to solve the problem, but without filling in the details.
5.  **Level 5 (Bridging)**: Content is at or near the target proficiency level. Focus on clarifying complex phrasing or multi-step reasoning in word problems.
6.  **Level 6 (Reaching)**: Minimal to no modification needed. The content should be presented in its original form, focusing on advanced problem-solving techniques and conceptual understanding.

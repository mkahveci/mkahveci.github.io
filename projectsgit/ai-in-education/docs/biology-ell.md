## Biology ELL Content Modification Template

| Section | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | I am a high school biology teacher at Chicago Public Schools. üë©‚Äçüè´ |
| **Content Area** | Biology |
| **Grade Level(s)** | 9th Grade |
| **Learning Target** | Students will be able to describe the process of photosynthesis, including the key reactants and products. |
| **Success Criteria** | Students can label a diagram of a plant cell with the correct locations for photosynthesis and write a two-sentence summary of the process. |
| **Input Text (Original Concept Summary)** | "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water." |

## Modified Content for ELL Proficiency Levels (REACH Scale)

### Level 1 (Entering)

The goal is to focus on **concrete actions** and **simplified vocabulary** using one idea per sentence.

**Modified Summary:**
Plants make their own food. Plants use **sunlight** (light energy) to do this. They take **water** and **air** (carbon dioxide). They make **sugar** (food) and **oxygen** (air we breathe). This happens in the leaves.

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Key Words & Symbols:** Provide a simple diagram with simplified labels:
    * Sunlight $\rightarrow$ Energy
    * Carbon Dioxide (Air) $\rightarrow$ Input
    * Water $\rightarrow$ Input
    * Sugar (Food) $\rightarrow$ Output
    * Oxygen (Air) $\rightarrow$ Output
* **Location:** Use a labeled picture of a plant and label the leaf as the "food maker."

***

### Level 2 (Beginning)

The goal is to use **short, simple sentences** and provide **visuals** and **explicit steps** for key terms.

**Modified Summary & Steps:**
**Photosynthesis** is how a plant creates its food. It turns light energy into stored energy (food).

**Steps of Photosynthesis:**
1.  A plant needs three things to start: **Sunlight** (energy).
2.  It needs **Water** from the soil.
3.  It needs **Carbon Dioxide** (a gas in the air).
4.  The plant mixes these three things in its leaves.
5.  The plant makes **Sugar** (food) and **Oxygen** (a gas) as the final products.

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Word Bank with Visuals:**
    * **Photosynthesis:** Making food with light.
    * **Sunlight:** Energy source.
    * **Carbon Dioxide:** Gas the plant takes in.
    * **Oxygen:** Gas the plant releases.
    * **Sugar:** Plant food (energy).
* **Sentence Frame for Summary:** "Photosynthesis is the process where plants use ________ and ________ to create ________."

***

### Level 3 (Developing)

The goal is to introduce **some academic vocabulary** using a **glossary** and helpful **analogies**.

**Modified Concept Explanation:**
Photosynthesis is the process plants use to **convert** (change) **light energy** from the sun into **chemical energy**. Think of it as the plant's **kitchen**: it uses simple ingredients to cook complex food.

The **reactants** (ingredients) are **carbon dioxide** (gas from the air) and **water**. The **products** (food created) are **sugar** (which stores the energy) and **oxygen**. This whole process **fuels** the plant's growth and activities.

**Support/Scaffolding:**
* **Analogy:** The **chloroplast** is like the plant‚Äôs kitchen.
* **Glossary of Academic Terms:**
    * **Convert:** To change from one form to another.
    * **Chemical Energy:** Energy stored in the bonds of molecules (like sugar).
    * **Reactants:** The starting materials (what goes in).
    * **Products:** The resulting materials (what comes out).
    * **Synthesize:** To make something complex from simpler parts.
* **Guided Practice:** Use the simple equation:
    $$\text{Sunlight} + \text{Water} + \text{Carbon Dioxide} \rightarrow \text{Sugar} + \text{Oxygen}$$

### Level 4 (Expanding)

The goal is to use **grade-level academic vocabulary** and a **direct sentence structure** with a **graphic organizer** to guide analysis.

**Modified Summary:**
**Photosynthesis** is the crucial **metabolic process** by which **autotrophs** (such as plants) **convert** **light energy** into **chemical energy**. This chemical energy is subsequently **stored** in **carbohydrate molecules** (sugars), which are **synthesized** from the **reactants**, **carbon dioxide** and **water**.

**Scaffolding Focus:** Using a structured organizer for reactants and products.

| Process Stage | Term/Chemical Name (Academic Vocabulary) | Simplified Meaning | Location in the Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy Source** | Light Energy | Power from the sun | N/A |
| **Reactant 1** | Water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$) | Taken in through roots | **Chloroplast** |
| **Reactant 2** | Carbon Dioxide ($\text{CO}_2$) | Gas taken in through leaves | **Chloroplast** |
| **Product 1** | Sugar (Carbohydrate/Glucose) | Stored food/energy for the plant | **Chloroplast** |
| **Product 2** | Oxygen ($\text{O}_2$) | Released gas | **Chloroplast** |

***

### Level 5 (Bridging)

The goal is to present **content at or near grade level**, focusing on **clarifying multi-step concepts** and **precise terminology**.

**Modified Concept Explanation:**
**Photosynthesis** is the **bio-chemical pathway** utilized by photoautotrophs. It **transduces** (changes) **solar energy** into **chemical potential energy** stored primarily in the high-energy bonds of **glucose** (a carbohydrate). This process requires the **absorption** of **carbon dioxide** and **water** as **initial reactants**. The net outcome is the production of $\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6$ (glucose) and the release of **molecular oxygen** ($\text{O}_2$) as a **by-product**.

**Scaffolding Focus:**
* **Clarification of Sub-Steps:** Briefly clarify that photosynthesis involves two main stages: the **Light-Dependent Reactions** (capturing light) and the **Calvin Cycle** (making sugar).
* **Vocabulary:** Ensure understanding of precise terms like *autotroph, transduce, potential energy, molecular oxygen, and by-product*.
* **The Chemical Equation:** Provide and explain the balanced chemical equation to reinforce the concept:
    $$6\text{CO}_2 + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Light Energy} \rightarrow \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\text{O}_2$$

### Level 6 (Reaching)

**Modified Prompt:**
**Original Input:** "Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water."

**Focus:** Minimal to no modification needed. Content is presented in its original form, focusing on **advanced scientific reasoning**. Students should be ready to discuss the **efficiency** of the process, the role of **chlorophyll** and specific **pigments**, and the **significance** of photosynthesis in the global carbon cycle.

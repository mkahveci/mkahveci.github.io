<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Interactivity and interaction are two terms that have been used very often in the literature of science, science education, computer science, educational technology, distance education, curriculum and instruction, and psychology (Chim et al., 2003; Fahy, 2003; Juwah, 2003; Kirsh, 1997; Tobin, 1993; Wagner, 1994). While reporting a recent review of the literature about interactivity in computer-mediated college and university education, Muirhead and Juwah (2004) emphasize that interactivity and interaction are critical in underpinning the learning process in face-to-face, campus based, and distance education.</p>

<p>Empirical and conceptual studies about interactivity and interaction are usually associated with operational definitions specific to the educational contexts investigated. Thus, while the importance of interactivity was emphasized in considerable studies in education (Anderson, 2002; Bork, 1982; Fahy, 2003; Fulford &amp; Zhang, 1993; Hirumi, 2002; D. Jonassen, 1988; D. H. Jonassen, 1985; Juwah, 2003; Kahveci, in press; Kirsh, 1997; Muirhead &amp; Juwah, 2004; Rose, 1999; Simpson &amp; Galbo, 1986; Sims, 1997, 2000; Wagner, 1989, 1990, 1994, 1997), there is no settled view of what it means for instruction (Kirsh, 1997). In fact, interactivity is essentially medium-specific (e.g. videodisks, distance education, educational software, etc.), somewhat arbitrary, and not very descriptive (Schwier &amp; Misanchuk, 1993) and so, there remain many unresolved questions about the nature of interactivity (Kirsh, 1997). The operational definitions and given meanings are generally context-dependent, and fluctuate from one meaning to another as the context in education changes. For example, Kirsh (1997) builds his argument on the concept of interactivity mostly as it applies to the design of multimedia learning environments along the lines of cognitive approach.</p>

<p>Also, due to the lack of theory to guide research, information available in the literature about the complex phenomenon of interactivity and interaction is rather limited (Anglin &amp; Morrison, 2003). In support of this issue, Sims (1997) states that “interactivity is important but there appears to be no consensus of what interactivity actually represents or involves.” Sims (2000) also claims that it is important to reassess not only the notion of interactivity but its role in enhancing the learning process in its various forms. Moreover, Fulford and Zhang (1993) suggest that the model of motivational categories can provide a framework to research interactivity in education. Too, Wagner (1990) recommends that future considerations of interaction and interactivity should draw upon the results of research from the following domains; learning and learning theory, instructional theory, instructional design, and instructional delivery.</p>

<p>In the following, as being the main instrument of an extensive research, the development of Interactivity Survey (the IS) is presented. With the IS, the research, whose findings will be reported by subsequent manuscripts somewhere else, investigates the perceptions of faculty members at colleges of education around the world about instructional interactivity by specifically undertaking a comparative analysis of the key aspects surrounding the functional definitions of interactivity, the existence of interactivity in various instructional settings, the attributes of interactivity as a function of motivation and learning theories, and the events of interactivity to discern any relationships that might exist with respect to the eight predictors; gender, age, present status, highest degree obtained, geographic region, research interest in interactivity, personal learning preferences, and department.</p>

<h2 id="2-developing-the-interactivity-survey-items">2 Developing the Interactivity Survey Items</h2>

<p>Interactivity Survey is composed of six subsections: (1) functional definitions of interactivity, (2) existence of interactivity in various instructional settings, the attributes of interactivity as a function of (3) motivation and (4) learning theory, (5) the events of interactivity, and (6) learning styles.</p>

<p>In the last section of the questionnaire, thirteen items measure learning styles (VARK Questionnaire), which were developed by Neil Fleming (2001) and were added to the IS with Fleming’s permission. Thus, the first five subsections were developed for this study while, due to the space requirements for the conference proceedings, the full resources for item development process were omitted (please contact with the author if you are interested). After developing the initial set of questions from the related literature, the content validity and its pilot study over a sub-sample were carried out.</p>

<h2 id="3-the-content-validity-of-the-interactivity-survey">3 The Content Validity of the Interactivity Survey</h2>

<p>Eight professors, who were the experts in the filed, assisted with the content validity of the interactivity survey. Validity has been defined as referring to the appropriateness, correctness, meaningfulness, and usefulness of the specific conclusions that researches derive from their data (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 2003, p.150). Of the eight professors, one professor was in the Department of Educational Leadership, and had experience of teaching courses via the Internet, one professor was working in a private company for a while and was very well known in the literature with her interactivity research focusing on conceptualization, and six professors were at the Department of Educational Leadership and Learning Systems. Of the six professors, one was an expert in learning and instructional theories, one was proficient in assessment and distance education, one was a survey researcher and statistics lecturer, and three were experts in instructional systems design.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this review process, a specific program was written in PHP and MySQL and an additional functionality was given to the online survey so that a reviewer was able to read each question and, while taking the survey, to evaluate its clarity by the following scale:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The item is clear.</li>
  <li>The item is somewhat clear.</li>
  <li>The item is not clear.</li>
</ol>

<p>Furthermore, a text area was provided for the reviewers to give their comments or suggestions to improve the clarity of an unclear item. The analysis of the reviewer evaluation provided the content-related evidence of validity, which assured that the content and format of the instrument were appropriate and comprehensive. The review process was completed in two phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>The First Phase Review</em>. Four professors participated in the first phase of content validation. I met with each of the reviewers while taking the survey. With the permission of the reviewers, I also recorded their verbal comments with a digital voice recorder. After making modifications on the ambiguous survey items, I sent the URL of the online survey for the second phase review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Second Phase Review</em>. One professor who participated in the first phase review agreed to review again for the second phase. The second phase review was completely performed online (i.e. no face-to-face interaction with the reviewers). In this process, the reviewers were able to rate the clarity of the items and type their comments on each item. The ratings for the first and second phase reviews were given below, in Figure 1. After making the second revisions on the survey items based on the comments of reviewers and observing the remarkable increase of ratings in the second phase review, I proceeded to conduct the pilot study with the final version of the survey instrument (as seen in Table 15).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="31-pilot-study">3.1 Pilot Study</h3>

<p>After developing the IS and making it fully functional online, the pilot study allowed the reliability analysis of the IS. The sample of the pilot procedure consisted of one professor from each university in the database, resulting in 314 faculty members. Of 314 invitation emails, 52 warning messages, indicating that the email could not be delivered, returned. Getting these kinds of messages was expected because I started to collect email addresses about two years ago. Thus, some email addresses may have been out-of-date. Secondly, server side delays or errors in delivering email messages or even SPAM filters whose rules are very strictly set (e.g. accepting emails only from certain domains and rejecting others) may have resulted in undeliverable messages, as well. As a result, the sample size for the pilot study turned out to be 262. The pilot study was completed in one week with two reminder emails. Of the 262 invitations, 59 faculty members participated in the study.</p>

<p>Using online surveys in research is getting more popular due to their high response rate. In a comparative study of response rate for mail, fax, and online survey in a university setting, Cobanoglu, Warde, and Moreo (2000) reported 42% response from online survey, 26% for mail survey, and (3) 17% for fax survey.</p>

Item clarity ratings of the experts participated in the content validity process.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Reliability refers to the consistency of the scores obtained (Fraenkel &amp; Wallen, 2003). I calculated the consistencies of the items within the instrument, which is called equivalent-forms method. This calculation required factor analyses to see the emerging categories among the items.</p>

<p>Initially there were 66 items, as presented in the earlier sections of this paper, developed to measure the following dimensions: (1) functional definitions of interactivity, (2) existence of interactivity in various instructional settings, the attributes of interactivity as a function of (3) motivation and of (4) learning theories, and (5) the events of interactivity. After the content validity process and the reliability analyses (of the pilot study), of the 66 items, 17 items causing internal inconsistency were removed from the survey. Thus, 49 items representing to and measuring the dependent variables left. Predictors or independent variables such as gender, age, present status, highest degree obtained, research interest in interactivity, department, and personal learning styles (VARK survey) remained with no changes.</p>

<h2 id="4-factor-loadings-and-the-internal-consistency-analyses">4 Factor Loadings and the Internal Consistency Analyses</h2>

<p>In this section, I apply two main statistical procedures to calculate the reliability of the instrument: (1) factor analysis and (2) Cronbach alpha internal consistency test. Factor loadings are the indicators of the commonalities that a group of variables measure. The components extracted are indicated as only numerical values rather than under a title because the purpose of this analysis is to calculate internal consistency. Deeper discussions on each component were given in the Chapter IV on the final survey data.</p>

<p>Although the reliability is moderately high on these items, they remained in the survey. The main reason was that the definitions of interactivity may be differently perceived by professors who were in different fields of education. That’s why; I decided that I should include these items in the final version of the survey. Besides, these operational definitions of interactivity are known in education literature and used in many researches. The items 1-5, 1-7, and 1-8 were removed because I thought their meanings were distributed among other given definitions.</p>

<h2 id="5-conclusion">5 Conclusion</h2>

<p>This study developed, 49-item instrument, the IS, to evaluate the perceptions of faculty members at colleges of education at universities around world. The instrument was originally designed for online data collection with an adaptive feature. Evidence for the instrument’s content validity and its reliability is based on the pilot study. Principle component analysis with Varimax rotation was applied to extract major components of the items.</p>

<p>Further research by the utilization of the IS also confirmed its reliability in a large scale (i.e. 2752 participants). Related manuscripts about the findings of that specific research are forthcoming and are planned to be submitted to this journal and elsewhere as well.</p>

<p>It seemed this instrument and its findings provided better understandings about the conundrum, Instructional Interactivity, by specifically undertaking and comparing the common perceptions of faculty members in the field of education. The participants of this study were experienced instructors, known researchers in various fields of education, and theory developers about instruction, instructional delivery, motivation, and learning.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>I would like to take this opportunity to present my sincere thanks to many people for their support, encouragement, and contributions in completing this work. This project would not be possible without the gifts of honesty, patience, and time given by the participants in this research. I cannot name them here, but I wish to express my sincere thanks for their contributions to my learning. Also, I am thankful to two institutions for opening their doors for me to carry out my research and teaching: Florida State University and Bogazici University.</p>

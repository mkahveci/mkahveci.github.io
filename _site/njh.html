    <div class="summary">The aim of this research is to empirically define the construct of science teachers’ pedagogical discontentment, a construct that describes teachers’ lack of satisfaction or contentment that occurs when they recognize a mismatch between their own pedagogical beliefs and goals and their actual classroom practices.</div>

<p>From a conceptual change perspective, we explore the meaning of pedagogical discontentment, and discuss its role in shaping teachers’ receptivity to messages of reform. In tandem with introducing this construct, we present an instrument to be used to measure teachers’ pedagogical discontentment, an instrument that eventually will allow science educators to better describe the affective states of teachers entering professional development experiences. To inform this instrument, we conducted interviews with practicing elementary and secondary science teachers to provide us with first-hand accounts of how teachers discuss aspects of their current science teaching practices that they perceived as being less effective than desired. From these interviews a group of 41 items were designed around a group of 5 subscales. The psychometric evaluation of these items is offered, along with suggestions for the revision of this instrument.</p>

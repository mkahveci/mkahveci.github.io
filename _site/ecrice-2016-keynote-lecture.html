<h3> Advancing CER </h3>
  <p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chemistry education research (CER) as a field is gradually advancing at university level.</li>
		<li>Two distinctive groups of expertise in the CER community:</li><ul>
		<li>One group (Group I) is made of chemists in pure science.</li>
		<li>Another group (Group II) is composed of chemistry educators.</li><ul>
	<ul>
</p>
</section>

<section style="text-align: left;">
	<h3> Group I </h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>This group of experts conduct their research in chemistry and take teaching role for chemistry courses close to their
			expertise.</li>
			<li>This group generates new knowledge in the filed of chemistry and creates new learning domains for the next generations.</li>
					<ul>
	</p>
</section>

<section style="text-align: left;">
	<h3> Group II </h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Chemistry educators teach introductory level chemistry courses and all levels of pedagogical courses at universities.</li>
			<li>Research-wise, chemistry educators conduct social and behavioral research on teaching and learning of chemistry.</li>
			<ul>
	</p>
</section>

<section style="text-align: left;">
	<h3> Cooperation of Groups I and II </h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>While informing policy makers and practice of teaching, chemistry education research needs to embrace both the depth and
			breadth of issues in chemistry and pedagogy.</li>
			<li>Thus, to advance chemistry education research, it is imperative that both group of experts need to cooperate mutually.</li>
			<ul>

	<h3>EU Report</h3>
	<p>The number of young people entering universities is increasing but they are choosing to study fields other than science;
	in consequence, the proportion of young people studying science is decreasing.</p>

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>In 2003, the total physical science graduates in the US dropped by 12% (about 88,000) in comparison to 1995 (about
				100,000)</li>
				<li>The same comparison for Germany is even more dramatic— 50,000 vs. 101,000—a 50% loss</li>
				<li>When looked at from a gender perspective the problem is even worse as, in general, females are less interested in
				science education than males.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Only 31.2% of the MST (i.e. mathematics, science, and technology) graduates in EU27 countries was female.</li>
						<li>Only 31.1% of MST graduates in the US in 2005 was female.</li>
					</ul>
				<ul>

	<h3>A Proposal for Innovative Methods in CER</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Huge efforts have been made towards better science teacher training across Europe.</li>
				<li>To support this action, the direction of chemistry education research should align the focus towards alternative
							and innovative methods for teacher training and practice of chemistry teaching.</li>
				<li>In response to the need for innovative methods in chemistry education research, I propose two directions:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Affective Domain</li>
					<li>Educational Technology for Rich Interactivity</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</p>

</section>

<section>
	<h4>Affective Domain</h4>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>New theoretical perspectives on how affective factors are the determinants of decision-making process and their
		implications to chemistry learning and teacher training are of interest.</li>
		<li>My suggestion is to adapt Dual-Process Theories into chemistry education research context.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h4>Dual-Process Theories</h4>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>An attempt to explain how behavior is generated through impulsive and reflective systems.</li>
		<li>The adaptation simply leads one to consider more affective aspects than usual and less cognitive aspects than usual.</li>
		<li>Therefore, practice of chemistry education from both teaching and research perspectives will likely to be more
		human-friendly.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section style="text-align: left">
	<h3>Fundamentals of Dual-Process Theories</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Dual-process models share a subset of beliefs about the quest for knowledge, opinions, and understanding.</li>
			<li>Duality refers to little or maximal cognitive effort while arriving a sense of knowing.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Top-down: Leaning on prior knowledge, heuristics, stereotypes, expectancies, scripts, and schemas</li>
				<li>Bottom-up: Expending a great deal of time, effort and mental energy in systematically building decisions, beliefs, and a
				sense of knowing</li>
				<li>Neither strategy guarantees a bias-free response; the two are just distinctive paths of arriving at knowledge.</li>
			</ul>

<section>
	<h4>The Reflective-Impulsive Determinants of Social Behavior: In Brief</h4>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Attempts to integrate cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms.</li>
			<li>Social behavior as the result of several determinants that may operate in accord or conflict with each other.</li>
			<li>Affect and emotion are understood as products of the reflective and the impulsive system.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</section>

<section style="text-align: left">
	<h3>Educational Technology for Rich Interactivity</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Advancements in computing power and reduction of their cost to individuals make educational technology more available to
			the public at large.</li>
			<li>The foci here are rich interactivity and self-study environments provided by the media through adaptive systems.</li>
			<li>Two emerging possibilities have been the topic of my recent projects at undergraduate level chemistry classrooms:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Easy deployment and use of Learning Objects (LO), and</li>
				<li>Integration of Student Response Systems (SRS).</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</p>
</section>

<section style="text-align: left">
	<h3>Student Response Systems (SRS)</h3>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>SRSs support in-class interaction which is ideal for face-to-face instruction.</li>
			<li>Instructor can gather responses from large groups of students instantly and some data analyses may be automated on
	the fly while showing students the instant results.</li>
			<li>From research point of view, two-tier instruments to uncover student conceptions may be developed using SRSs
	because they provide the infrastructure to gather open-ended inputs from students.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Conclusions</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>The reflective-impulsive model explains the behavior and its determinants in a sophisticated manner, which is likely to
			direct the chemistry education research community towards focusing in more affective elements than usual.</li>
			<li>Use of new technologies such as LOs and SRSs will increase increase the interactivity in chemistry classes, which will
			allow more chances to have different assessment tools, faster and more in-depth data collection processes.</li>
		</ul>

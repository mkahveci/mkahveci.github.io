          <!-- <p>Teachers play a key role in moving reform-based science education practices into the classroom. Based on research that emphasizes the importance of teachers’ affective states, this study aimed to explore the constructs pedagogical discontentment, science teaching self-efficacy, intentions to reform, and their correlations. Also, it aimed to provide empirical evidence in light of a previously proposed theoretical model while focusing on an entirely new context in Middle East. Data were collected in Saudi Arabia with a total of randomly selected 994 science teachers, 656 of whom were females and 338 were males. To collect the data, the Arabic versions of the Science Teachers’ Pedagogical Discontentment scale, the Science Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument and the Intentions to Reform Science Teaching scale were developed. For assuring the validity of the instruments in a non-Western context, rigorous cross-cultural validations procedures were followed. Factor analyses were conducted for construct validation and descriptive statistical analyses were performed including frequency distributions and normality checks. Univariate analyses of variance were run to explore statistically significant differences between groups of teachers. Cross-tabulation and correlation analyses were conducted to explore relationships. The findings suggest effect of teacher characteristics such as age and professional development program attendance on the affective states. The results demonstrate that teachers who attended a relatively higher number of programs had lower level of intentions to reform raising issues regarding the conduct and outcomes of professional development. Some of the findings concerning interrelationships among the three constructs challenge and serve to expand the previously proposed theoretical model.

          <!-- <p>Oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the blood and its delivery from the lung to the tissues are conceptually assessed by a new two-tier diagnostic test. This study presents the development stages and the validity evidence of the two-tier diagnostic test. The validity measure relies on seven expert opinions who are professors and actively teach- ing biochemistry courses across the United States. The remaining number of questions turns out to be 11. Besides, the analysis of the preliminary data, which is expected to be about 30 undergraduates, will provide the evidence on students’ conceptual patterns about oxygen binding to hemoglobin and its delivery to tissues. In conclusion, this study contributes to the chemistry education research by a new instrument on a difficult-to-learn biochemistry topic and its preliminary results.

Paper presented at DePaul University Teaching and Learning Conference. Workshop. Chicago, IL, USA. May 5, 2017.

          <!-- <p>Conceptual understanding is one of the essential levels of understanding in biochemistry. Some topics in biochemistry also require students to use complex graphical representations and mathematical knowledge to understand concepts and explain physiological phenomena. This workshop focuses on how to measure students’ conceptual understanding in the context of undergraduate biochemistry course at DePaul University.
The topic of oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the blood and its delivery from the lung to tissues will be assessed not only by asking direct information, which may eventually be answered by recalling and recognizing (i.e. rote learning), but also by asking students’ reasoning behind their answers. This topic is difficult for students to learn. Students are expected to interpret how oxygen pressure determines the oxygen saturation level in hemoglobin; how to map out the saturation level at a given pressure thus the amount of oxygen delivered; how tissue acidity correlates with the level of CO2 carbon dioxide, and how changes in both as well as another modulator molecule affect the release of oxygen from hemoglobin to tissue thus its delivery from the lung to tissues and the adaptation of a person to high altitude.

This presentation will introduce a valid and reliable method to effectively develop and easily deploy learning objects (i.e. Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)) in context of physical chemistry (PChem) course at DePaul University.

Paper presented at the European Conference on Research in Chemical Education (ECRICE), Barcelona. September 7 – 10, 2016.

          <!-- <p>Chemistry education research as a field is gradually advancing at university level. When speaking of chemistry educators and researchers, two distinctive groups of expertise emerge. One group, Group I, is made of chemists in pure science. This group of experts conduct their research in chemistry and take teaching role for chemistry courses close to their expertise. Another group, Group II, is composed of chemistry educators, who teach introductory level chemistry courses and all levels of pedagogical courses. Research-wise, chemistry educators conduct social and behavioral research on teaching and learning of chemistry. While informing policy makers and practice of teaching, chemistry education research needs to embrace both the depth and breadth of issues in chemistry and pedagogy. Thus, to ad- vance chemistry education research, it is imperative that both group of experts need to cooperate mutually.

          <!-- <p>The Science Teachers’ Pedagogical Discontentment (STPD) scale has formerly been developed in the United States and used since 2006. Based on the perceptions of selected teachers, the scale is deeply rooted in the cultural and national standards. Given these limitations, the measurement integrity of its scores has not yet been conclusively established internationally, such as in the Saudi Arabia context. The items of the scale are slightly tailored to make the instrument suitable in the specific context, such as with respect to country-based regulations, reforms, and everyday practices of science teachers and their professional development initiatives. Item-based descriptive statistics, the measure’s factor structure as opposed to its former validity studies, and factor-based reliability scores are investigated in the present report. Thus, this study extends the validity and reliability measures of the instrument to the international scale and further confirms its appropriateness to measure teacher attitudes towards inquiry- based science education initiatives.

          <!-- <p>The Science Teachers’ Pedagogical Discontentment scale has formerly been developed in the United States and used since 2006. Based on the perceptions of selected teachers, the scale is deeply rooted in the cultural and national standards. Given these limitations, the measurement integrity of its scores has not yet been conclusively established internationally, such as in the Saudi Arabia context. The items of the scale are slightly tailored to make the instrument suitable in the specific context, such as with respect to country-based regulations, reforms, and everyday practices of science teachers and their professional development initiatives. Item-based descriptive statistics, the measure’s factor structure as opposed to its former validity studies, and factor-based reliability scores are investigated in the present report. Thus, this study extends the validity and reliability measures of the instrument to the international scale and further confirms its appropriateness to measure teacher attitudes towards inquiry-based science education initiatives.

          <!-- <p>This study examines the affective states of students who are chemistry majors at the junior and senior levels, in the context of a Physical Chemistry II (PChem II) course. The study relies on students’ self-reflections while they respond to an online survey system. The online survey includes three sections: demographics, Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP), and Modified Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales (mFSMAS). The RTOP instrument is used by the students to describe the teaching in the PChem II class. The mFSMAS was chosen to measure attitudes from the gender differences point of view. Internal consistency analyses indicate that the instruments are reliable. The findings reveal that females do not perceive themselves as being disadvantaged when it comes to learning PChem II topics. The same conclusion is valid for their male counterparts. In addition, RTOP, as rated by students, describes the nature of the PChem II as traditional, lecture-based instruction. A significant correlation coefficient between the composite scores of RTOP and mFSMAS indicates that the use of inquiry-based teaching strategies correlates to positive student affective states toward learning physical chemistry. Accordingly, in the case of the specific PChem II course examined in this study, the dominance of lecturing led to low to moderate positive attitudes toward the course.

Significant differences are found in the variables of availability of a computer to use, experience of computer use, frequency of computer use for different purposes, and attitudes towards computers. Connections with mathematics anxiety are also discussed. Results indicate that boys have more positive attitude towards computers and they tend to use computers more frequently. While socioeconomic level increases, experiences in computer use and Internet use and positive attitudes towards computers increase.

From a conceptual change perspective, we explore the meaning of pedagogical discontentment and discuss its role in shaping teachers’ receptivity to messages of reform. We present an instrument that can be used to measure teachers’ pedagogical discontentment, an instrument that will allow science educators to better describe the affective states of teachers as they enter professional development experiences. The items for the initial instrument were derived from a series of interviews with practicing teachers; from these interviews, a group of 42 items were designed around a group of five subscales. The final instrument, revised after two rounds of field testing, includes 21 multiple-choice items clustered around six subscales (subscales derived from interviews with science teachers).

This three-year, National Science Foundation-funded project is working measure the fidelity of implementation of standards-based science and mathematics instructional materials at the K-8 level in a large urban school district through the development and application of a suite of FOI instruments. This first strand focused on the development of a conceptual framework for describing FOI. We began with a thorough review of previous work on FOI, then engaged in an iterative process of theoretical review and framework development. We determined that the framework needed to comprise categories of critical components (the essential elements of the intended program model) and engaged in a process of science instructional materials review that focused on identifying of these critical components and placing them into framework categories. This paper will describe the application of the framework to the development of instruments, and the ways this framework will help to accurately describe teacher use of science instructional materials and support our ability to provide useful, meaningful information about FOI to the school district being served.

          <!-- <p>This paper describes the outcomes of the first strand of the “Applied Research on Science Materials Implementation: Bringing Measurement of Fidelity of Implementation (FOI) to Scale” project. This three-year, National Science Foundation-funded project has two main goals. First, is the measurement of fidelity of implementation of K-8 science and mathematics instructional materials in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). Second, is the development of a suite of instruments to measure the fidelity of implementation of standards-based science and mathematics instructional materials at the K-8 level. In order to achieve these goals, our first step was the development of a conceptual framework for describing fidelity of implementation. This paper describes the development and components of the FOI Conceptual Framework.

          <!-- <p>This review investigates the use of certain types of interaction in mathematics education. These types include interaction between students, interaction between teacher and students, and interaction between students and leaning technology. Student-technology interactions are explained by computer programs that use problem-solving strategies and multiple representations. Interaction between teacher and students are explained in two categories, classroom interaction and small group interaction. Teachers need to consider many factors in order to establish a classroom environment to enhance the mathematical understanding of their students. In small cooperative groups, factors that effect interaction are as follows: group composition, type of interaction, effect of teacher, interdependence of students and nature of the task. We provide some teaching implications of the findings as follows: students should be encouraged to use multiple representations to develop problem solving strategies; students’ motivation to learn should be mastery goal oriented, teachers should try to create contexts for mathematical argumentation; teachers should encourage student participation in classroom discussions; students should be expected to provide mathematical reasoning rather than producing the right answer; and design of tasks should be suitable to promote skills such as mathematical reasoning and metacognition.

          <!-- <p>This research investigated the perceptions of the faculty members at colleges of education around the world about instructional interactivity by specifically undertaking a comparative analysis of the key aspects surrounding the functional definitions of interactivity, the existence of interactivity in various instructional settings, the attributes of interactivity as a function of motivation and learning theories, and the events of interactivity to discern any relationships that might exist with respect to the eight predictors; gender, age, present status, highest degree obtained, geographic region, research interest in interactivity, personal learning preferences (the strength of the VARK score), and department. The study was based on an online survey investigating instructional interactivity. The content and reliability analyses of the survey instrument indicated high degree of internal consistency and validity among the items. Two-thousand-seven-hundred-fifty-two of 14792 faculty members completed the survey, for a response rate of 18.1%. Findings indicated that the faculty members perceived all presented instructional events in various settings from moderately high to high interactivity. In addition, the perceptions of faculty members about instructional interactivity varied with their personal characteristics that were mentioned above as predictors. This result indicated that interactivity was context dependent, stemming from various factors. Also, the ratings of faculty members strongly associated interactivity with learning theory (Conditions of Learning) and motivation (ARCS Model). This study is important since at present there is no settled view of what interactivity and interaction mean in education context and owing to this fact information available in the literature on research into the complex phenomenon of interactivity and interaction is rather limited. And, despite this limitation, interactivity and interaction are attributed to be critical in promoting and enhancing effective learning.

This technique allows one to photographically print micropatterns on polished silicon wafer surface in high precision along with great reproducibility.

The patterned silicon wafer is used to cast poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) polymer, giving rise to negative replica (valley) on the PDMS surface. Because the fabrication is inexpensive and technologically feasible, this technique allows one to integrate micro-fluidic devices in various experimental designs.

It is believed that Interactivity increases learning in educational settings. In this study, I focused on the interactivity component of the EcoVentures program during instruction in middle and high school science classes. EcoVentures is a CD-I program targeting middle school students. For this study, on-line teacher and student surveys were conducted, interviews with teachers and students, and classroom observations were done. Teacher and student attitudes about the program are described. Forms of interactivity and effects on attitudes were investigated. The attitudes of the teachers and students revealed that both groups were positive towards the Interactivity component of the program.

<title>The summative evaluation of the EcoVentures program in terms of its interactivity component &#8211; kahveci group</title>
<meta name="description" content="Although the term “Interactivity” had been in use long before computer programs became a common feature of curriculum materials, little research has been done about the effectiveness of interactivity in education. It is believed that Interactivity increases learning in educational settings. In this study, I focused on the interactivity component of the EcoVentures program during instruction in middle and high school science classes. EcoVentures is a CD-I program targeting middle school students. For this study, on-line teacher and student surveys were conducted, interviews with teachers and students, and classroom observations were done. Teacher and student attitudes about the program are described. Forms of interactivity and effects on attitudes were investigated. The attitudes of the teachers and students revealed that both groups were positive towards the Interactivity component of the program. However, tenth grade students were prone to be less interested in the use of the program than eighth graders.

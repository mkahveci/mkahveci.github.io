&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-area-values-for-the-pure-substances&quot;&gt;The area values for the pure substances&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These values can be extracted from the Liquid data (the first table) and Gas data (the second table) separately. So, we will read this information as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When Part A equals to 1.0, it is &lt;strong&gt;pure pentane&lt;/strong&gt;. Pure pentane has both liquid and gas phases.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Liquid area: $ 5.10 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gas area: $ 6.19 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When Part A equals to 0.0, it is &lt;strong&gt;pure hexane&lt;/strong&gt;. Pure hexane has both liquid and gas phases.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Liquid area: $ 6.57 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Gas area: $ 2.82 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Professor Kahveci,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I just wanted to extend a sincere thank you to you and the entire Chemistry department, including our TA’s, for your compassion and understanding during these turbulent times. With everything going on, we’ve all been under an unusual amount of mental stress and I’m sure that extends to the teaching staff as well, so I hope you’ve all been well. The content in this class is not easy to grasp, but without the efforts of the staff making this information so comprehensible considering the short notice of this transition, I’m sure things could have been much worse. Also, I have seen a lot of leeway being given throughout this quarter in regards to grading and submission of assignments, and for me personally that has taken some of the stress out of this transition to our remote learning experience this quarter. It’s for this alleviation that I thank you all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Andres&lt;/p&gt;

The rubric will be tied to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Grades&lt;/code&gt; module so that the rubric-based assessment  is automatically translated to an associated grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new--folder-in-submissions-with-annotation-tools&quot;&gt;New  Folder in Submissions with Annotation Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Navigate to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Submissions&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New Folder&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RO8wz-Yk-zEWLY8T4hDW_MwijWkt9FZvRU3awtCO0ZnXzl8XchwhftRwUClP0NSB2CX1Ana9OcpNZRytc-3SxK1hYer3fm4SdjzSRZpWtYqKQjDk5cDtcpZAtDMYtMxvIf_8xpqOZ3k=w2400&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;: Give a name to the folder. e.g. Lab 1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Grade Item&lt;/code&gt; from the dropdown list. You can add &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;New Grade Item&lt;/code&gt;, if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Add Rubric&lt;/code&gt; button and select a rubric from the list. If you don’t see a rubric, you need to &lt;a href=&quot;/ydt#rubric&quot;&gt;import&lt;/a&gt; one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E8GcpGqbGk4_0M193wpGcSw9EzSQMuU2RZP08AabWHpaaE6HdU2GpGTfAjxYczxZ8UpuYpGyTfhaikm8FLmHjv74HCo7fLfilRW9pOIyQixNO2ewg1wNo2220tD-jXWj3ci12Lu722Q=w2400&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Annotation Tools&lt;/code&gt; is checked. This is very important if you want to open the files submitted (without downloading) and give feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rubric&quot;&gt;Importing a Rubric&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;method-1-copying-from-my-course&quot;&gt;Method 1: Copying from my Course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may import rubrics like any other components in D2L. I will be posting rubrics for SQ20-CHE 133 and SQ20-CHE 135 this quarter. To import a rubric:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Course Administration&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Import Components&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Search for offering&lt;/code&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHE_135_901_1050&lt;/code&gt; in the search box to import a rubric for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHE 135&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHE_133_303_1050&lt;/code&gt; in the search box to import a rubric for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CHE 133&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FtkR0eeILqBRZ8IjZwo04U1l7vRuj8r6ate0ceCsmr3VHHEsjSOMX54QVEZLLu5ZANGEm5UoURcm6hQi-tBdSLWN7qLRm3OoDiRhJCmPDzgNS63YmLcWinZjRiLzpw_4-0STtZ34j8Y=w2400&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Select Components&lt;/code&gt; and then check &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Rubrics&lt;/code&gt; to import.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for copying and done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;method-2-importing-as-an-external-zip-file&quot;&gt;Method 2: Importing as an External ZIP File&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method is for those who cannot import from my course. Originally, I did not think this would be a problem but I was notified that it was not possible to import a component from my course unless you were enrolled as a TA or instructor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, grab the rubric file as a ZIP from the shared Box folder.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In this folder, navigate to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Online Rubrics to Import D2L&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Any of these files must be imported to D2L as a ZIP file. So, don’t unzip. Naming convention:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SQ20-CHE133-lab-1-online-rubric-to-import-as-ZIP-file.zip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SQ20-CHE135-lab-1-online-rubric-to-import-as-ZIP-file.zip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On D2L, go to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Course Administration&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Import Components&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Import Components&lt;/code&gt; (again as submenu) and select and upload the ZIP file you grabbed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for copying and done!&lt;/li&gt;

It was postponed to meet on February 1-5, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important dates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open for Paper Submissions: August 1, 2020&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended &lt;a href=&quot;/hnw&quot;&gt;IOSTE in Istanbul&lt;/a&gt; to present a project idea in 2015. The conference gathers many scholars across the Globe and provides high interactivity through lecture series, new project ideas, and poster sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Safety is a core value of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en.html&quot;&gt;American Chemical Society&lt;/a&gt; and their Divisions and as such the health and well-being of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.divched.org/&quot;&gt;DivCHED&lt;/a&gt; members, the Chemical Education community, and our volunteers are paramount. After careful deliberation and discussion with the 2020 Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (BCCE) program committee and the DivCHED Biennial Conference Committee, the Executive Committee for the Division of Chemical Education has decided to cancel (terminate) the 2020 Biennial Conference on Chemical Education scheduled for July 18-23, 2020, at Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We regret to inform you of the cancellation of the 2020 NARST conference in Portland, OR. This decision was made by the NARST Executive Board after much discussion and in light of our primary concern, which is the health and well-being of our members, located in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forums&lt;/strong&gt; are used to house discussion topics that are similar. For example, there might be several discussions in the first week of the course, so create a forum titled “Week One Discussions” for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt; are where the discussion actually takes place. This is where students can post threads in response to a discussion prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threads&lt;/strong&gt; are the initial comments added to a discussion topic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replies&lt;/strong&gt; are responses posted to a specific discussion thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up a discussion is a two-step process: first create a forum that can hold one or more discussion topics, then create discussion topics within that forum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;create-a-discussion-forum&quot;&gt;Create a Discussion Forum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select Discussions in the course navigation bar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the New button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select New Forum from the dropdown menu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter a title [A] (required).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter a description [B] (optional).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the Save and Close [C] button.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Select a forum from the Forums dropdown menu (or select the New Forum to create a new forum.)&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group or section topic&lt;/strong&gt;: everyone can access the topic, but students only see threads from their group or section (course must have groups set up before setting up group- or section-based topics).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter a title [B] (required).&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hi Dr. Kahveci,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I just wanted to say thank you for being an awesome chemistry teacher the past 2 classes. You truly are amazing and one of the best. I had to take chemistry 2 times and you truly helped me feel like I could do my best. I just wanted to say you’re amazing at your job and made a huge impact on my college course. I hope you have a wonderful break and get through all the craziness of this next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Madison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Containing a diversity of institutions, the U.S. higher education system serves a range of students and strives to meet many societal goals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Science and engineering (S&amp;amp;E) fields continue to grow across degree levels. In numbers and as a percentage of total degrees, S&amp;amp;E degrees increased at the associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral levels between 2000 and 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many groups of Americans remain underrepresented among S&amp;amp;E degree recipients.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The United States remains the destination for the largest number of internationally mobile students worldwide. However, over the past 2 years, the total number of international students enrolled in U.S. institutions has declined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Among the major S&amp;amp;E degree–producing countries worldwide, China has seen a rapid increase in its S&amp;amp;E degree production over time, compared with a more moderate rise in the United States and the European Union.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. higher education system consists of diverse academic institutions—including research and doctorate-granting universities, primarily undergraduate institutions, minority-serving institutions, community colleges, and others, including some that span multiple categories—that train students in S&amp;amp;E across degree levels and fields. A small number of institutions awarded three-quarters of doctorates, nearly half of master’s degrees, and 40% of bachelor’s degrees in S&amp;amp;E fields in 2017. These institutions are also where most university research is performed (see the forthcoming Science and Engineering Indicators 2020 report “Academic Research and Development”): integration of academic S&amp;amp;E research and doctoral education is a key feature of the U.S. system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More students are earning S&amp;amp;E degrees. In numbers and as a percentage of total degrees, S&amp;amp;E degrees increased at the associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral levels between 2000 and 2017. In addition, community colleges train students in S&amp;amp;E and related fields including technologies, contributing to the pool of talent that earns higher degrees and to the development of the skilled technical workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the costs of higher education have increased over time, the percentages of bachelor’s and doctoral degree recipients who graduate with debt have remained roughly the same over the last 10 years. Among graduate students, sources of financial aid differ dramatically between master’s and doctoral students. In 2017, one-third of S&amp;amp;E master’s students received funding, in contrast to around 90% of S&amp;amp;E doctoral students. Most S&amp;amp;E doctoral students rely on multiple funding sources (e.g., institutional, federal) and mechanisms (e.g., research and teaching assistantships and fellowships). The federal role in S&amp;amp;E graduate training remains important, although it has diminished over time. In 2017, the federal government supported 15% of full-time S&amp;amp;E graduate students (down from nearly 21% in 2004), including around one-quarter of doctoral students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many groups of Americans remain underrepresented among S&amp;amp;E degree recipients. Women are at or approaching parity with men at most degree levels overall, but within fields, long-standing differences persist, especially in engineering, computer sciences, and mathematics and statistics. Blacks are underrepresented at all degree levels; Hispanics and American Indians and Alaska Natives are underrepresented at all but the associate’s level. Members of different racial and ethnic groups are more likely to earn S&amp;amp;E degrees, especially doctorates, from for-profit institutions, which may have consequences for debt levels and career outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. higher education system remains a top destination for foreign S&amp;amp;E students. Although 2018 marked a second year of decline in the total number of foreign students studying in the United States, the decline was small (less than 1%), and more undergraduate and graduate students were studying S&amp;amp;E fields. Four countries—China, India, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia—account for more than half of foreign students in the United States. The number of Chinese S&amp;amp;E graduate students studying in the United States has continued to increase (by 11% over the last 2 years), whereas the number of Indian S&amp;amp;E graduate students sharply declined (by 22% over the last 2 years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign students account for about one-third of U.S. S&amp;amp;E doctorate recipients, a relatively stable proportion over time. They account for half or more of the doctorate recipients in engineering, computer sciences, and economics. China, India, and South Korea are the top three source countries for foreign recipients of U.S. S&amp;amp;E doctoral degrees. In comparison, students on temporary visas earn a smaller share (around 5%) of S&amp;amp;E bachelor’s degrees; however, the number of these students has more than doubled over the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other nations’ higher education systems have become increasingly competitive. S&amp;amp;E first university degrees awarded by Chinese institutions doubled to 1.7 million between 2005 and 2015, far outpacing most other countries, including the United States. Institutions in the United States award more S&amp;amp;E doctoral degrees than any other nation. However, in natural sciences and engineering, China surpassed the United States in 2007 as the world’s largest producer of doctoral degrees and has remained so since.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Murat Kahveci</name><email>mkahveci@gmail.com</email></author><category term="STEM" /><summary type="html">This report is prepared by the National Science Board.

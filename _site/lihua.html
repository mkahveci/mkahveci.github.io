<meta name="description" content="Dr. Lihua Jin received her B.S. (1984) and M.S. (1987) in Chemistry from Fudan University in China and her Ph.D. (1996) from Princeton University. Her Ph.D. and postdoctoral training was on the study of protein structure-function relationships using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Her independent research started in 1999 as a faculty member working with undergraduates at the State University of New York College at Geneseo (1999-2002) and later with both undergraduates and M.S. students at DePaul University (2002-present). At SUNY Geneseo her research was focused on the biochemical study of protein-lipid interactions in the context of lipoproteins.  At DePaul University her research has been focused on the study of molecular interactions using ITC, specifically interactions involving protein-small molecule, protein-DNA, peptide-metal ions and small molecule-metal ions. Dr. Jin’s other research focus is in improving student learning.  She has collaborated with Dr. Murat Kahveci, a chemistry education expert and adjunct faculty of DePaul University, in the creation of two-tier diagnostic instrument to measure biochemistry course taker’s conceptual understanding.

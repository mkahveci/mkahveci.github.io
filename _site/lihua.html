<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p><a href="https://csh.depaul.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/chemistry/lihua-jin.aspx">Dr. Lihua Jin</a> received her B.S. (1984) and M.S. (1987) in Chemistry from <a href="www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a> in China and her Ph.D. (1996) from <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. Her Ph.D. and postdoctoral training was on the study of protein structure-function relationships using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Her independent research started in 1999 as a faculty member working with undergraduates at the State University of <a href="https://www.geneseo.edu/">New York College at Geneseo</a> (1999-2002) and later with both undergraduates and M.S. students at DePaul University (2002-present). At SUNY Geneseo her research was focused on the biochemical study of protein-lipid interactions in the context of lipoproteins.  At <a href="https://www.depaul.edu/">DePaul University</a> her research has been focused on the study of molecular interactions using ITC, specifically interactions involving protein-small molecule, protein-DNA, peptide-metal ions and small molecule-metal ions. Dr. Jin’s other research focus is in improving student learning.  She has collaborated with <a href="/team/murat-kahveci/">Dr. Murat Kahveci</a>, a chemistry education expert and adjunct faculty of <a href="https://www.depaul.edu/">DePaul University</a>, in the creation of two-tier diagnostic instrument to measure biochemistry course taker’s conceptual understanding.</p>

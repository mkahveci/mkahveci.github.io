<p>Today, interactivity is seen as a key factor for achieving effective learning environments. Research says that “Interactivity” is a messy idea that takes its meaning from a system of metaphysical oppositions. These oppositions range from learner control issue to the debate. A group of academicians and researchers were asked to imagine a “Richly Interactive Learning Environment” to the fullest degree possible. The commonalities and differences in their ideas are investigated in order to come up with a shared understanding of interactivity for the new millennium. The aim of this article, is to both deconstruct and reconstruct a theory for interactivity with some real ground from previous research, ideas from that group, and from the ideas of the authors, as a whole. With this framework in hand, we hope that it will be possible to differentiate the real promises of “interactivity” from the wonderland promises.</p>

<p>
  I believe that effective teaching lies at the intersection of fostering cognitive understanding and nurturing affective growth. My approach is grounded in constructivist principles, which emphasize the value of students' prior experiences and encourage active engagement. By creating interactive, inquiry-based learning environments, I aim to equip students with critical thinking skills and a deep connection to scientific concepts. Whether in general or physical chemistry, my teaching strategies integrate collaborative activities, hands-on experiences, and educational technology to ensure students see the relevance of chemistry in societal and personal contexts.

  My philosophy extends beyond the classroom to inspire lifelong learners who are empowered to use scientific knowledge to address real-world challenges. Drawing on evidence-based research, I develop and employ innovative tools, such as diagnostic assessments and interactive modules, to help students overcome conceptual difficulties. This holistic approach not only enhances their academic success but also fosters confidence and a passion for learning. Through my teaching, I strive to support students in becoming critical thinkers, problem solvers, and informed contributors to the global community.

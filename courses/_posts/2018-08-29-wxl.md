## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive exploration of **physical chemistry principles** as they apply to complex **biochemical systems**. Students learn to analyze and interpret the behavior of biomolecules by studying topics such as **solution thermodynamics, kinetics, and equilibria**. The curriculum delves into the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and their application to biochemical reactions, addressing questions about reaction spontaneity and energy considerations. It also covers the principles of **quantum mechanics**, **chemical bonding**, and **modern spectroscopic techniques** used to determine and interpret molecular structures. The course is designed to equip students with the necessary knowledge and analytical skills to understand the physical-chemical foundations of biological processes.

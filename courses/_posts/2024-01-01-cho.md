## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course builds upon foundational skills from General Chemistry Lab A, focusing on advanced concepts and techniques. Students explore **intermolecular forces, phase changes, and chromatography** through a series of experiments. The curriculum also delves into **chemical kinetics, equilibrium, and acid-base chemistry**, providing practical experience with **UV-vis instrumentation** and other analytical tools. A key component of the course is the continued development of **scientific writing skills**, with students documenting their work in a lab notebook and preparing formal lab reports. The overall goal is to enhance students' ability to apply qualitative and quantitative techniques to collect, analyze, and interpret experimental data while reinforcing a commitment to **laboratory safety**.

## Course Description
This course provides foundational knowledge in **organic chemistry**, focusing on the **structure, bonding, and reactivity of organic molecules**. The curriculum covers key concepts such as **stereochemistry**, nomenclature, and the synthesis of **alcohols, ethers, and aliphatic hydrocarbons**. A major emphasis is placed on understanding modern theories of bonding and using **curly arrows** to represent electron flow in reactions. Students also explore principles of **sustainability** and **green chemistry**. The course is designed to develop problem-solving skills and the ability to analyze, evaluate, and present results effectively. The goal is to move beyond rote memorization, equipping students with a deep conceptual understanding of organic chemistry principles and their practical applications.

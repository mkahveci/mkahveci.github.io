## Course Description

Physical Chemistry II (Quantum Mechanics) (CHEM 422A) delves into the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics, a pivotal area in physical chemistry. This course, independent of Chemistry 321, requires students to have a solid grasp of calculus and its applications in chemistry. To ensure comprehension and application, the course structure includes working on problems in groups, with a portion of these problems contributing to the final grade. Additionally, Chem 422 students are tasked with writing a short paper on a peer-reviewed journal article relevant to the course material.

The course content covers a wide array of quantum mechanics topics. Starting with the quantization of energy and wave-particle duality, it progresses to the Schrödinger equation and mathematical principles necessary for quantum chemistry. Key concepts such as the Born interpretation, Hermitian operators, and the uncertainty principle are thoroughly explored. The course also examines various quantum systems like particles in a box, well, on a ring, and on a sphere, along with discussions on space quantization, spin, and atomic spectra.

Advanced topics include time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory, tunneling, the study of hydrogenic atoms, and the complexities of helium and heavier atoms. The course delves into spin multiplicities, spin-orbit coupling, the Born-Oppenheimer principle, and theories like Valence Bond (VB) and Molecular Orbital (MO) theory. Additionally, the course addresses point-group symmetry and the general theory of spectroscopies, with specific lectures on rotational, vibrational, electronic spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance.

The required texts for this course are Atkins and de Paula's “Physical Chemistry” (9th edition) and Heine, Joswig, Gelessus's “Computational Chemistry Workbook: Learning through Examples.” This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of quantum mechanics' principles and their applications in physical chemistry.

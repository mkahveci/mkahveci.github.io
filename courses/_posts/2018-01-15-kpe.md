## Course Description
This course delves into the fundamental principles of **quantum mechanics** and their application to physical chemistry. The curriculum begins with foundational concepts such as **wave-particle duality** and the **Schrödinger equation**, exploring the mathematical principles essential for quantum chemistry. Key topics include the **Born interpretation, Hermitian operators**, and the **uncertainty principle**. The course examines various quantum systems and their properties, progressing to the study of **atomic structure**, **molecular bonding theories** (Valence Bond and Molecular Orbital), and molecular symmetry. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to **spectroscopies**, including **rotational, vibrational, and electronic spectroscopy**, as well as **nuclear magnetic resonance**. Through problem-solving and analysis of peer-reviewed literature, students gain a comprehensive understanding of quantum mechanics and its vital role in understanding chemical systems.

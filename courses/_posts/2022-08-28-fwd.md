## Course Description

Chem 173 is designed to complement the concepts covered in [CHEM 171](/hsm) (lecture), providing hands-on experience with fundamental principles of chemistry relevant to engineering applications. Through a series of engaging experiments, students will explore various topics, including the chemistry of ordinary materials, thermochemistry, energy relationships in chemical equations, and qualitative analysis of unknowns.

_This course encourages critical thinking, data analysis, and effective laboratory techniques, preparing students for the practical applications of chemistry in their engineering endeavors._

## Textbook and Materials

1. Lab manuals will be provided free of charge in both PDF format and hardcopy. Download it from `Sakai > Resources > Lab Manuals`.
2. You will need one bound laboratory notebook, such as a National-brand composition book sold in Barnes and Noble or Beckâ€™s bookstore. You will need laboratory goggles and a lab coat. All of which are available at the bookstore.
3. You will need an inexpensive calculator having logarithmic (base 10 and base e), exponential, and trigonometric functions to do routine mole-mass and volumetric calculations associated with this lab.

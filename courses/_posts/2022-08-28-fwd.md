## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course is designed to complement the concepts of general chemistry with a focus on **engineering applications**. Through a series of engaging experiments, students explore the practical application of fundamental principles, including the **chemistry of everyday materials**, **thermochemistry**, and **energy relationships in chemical equations**. The curriculum also covers **qualitative analysis of unknown substances** and the determination of equilibrium constants. A key component of the course is the development of essential laboratory skills, such as **data analysis** and the use of proper techniques. Students maintain a bound lab notebook for all their work. The course prepares students to apply chemical principles effectively to their engineering endeavors.

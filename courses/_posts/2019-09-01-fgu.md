## Course Description
This course is the first in a three-quarter sequence designed to provide a foundational understanding of chemistry. It covers key topics including **units and dimensional analysis**, **atomic structure**, and the **electronic structure of atoms** and their **periodic properties**. Students delve into **chemical bonding** and **molecular structure**, learning how to apply theories like Valence Bond and Molecular Orbital theory to describe chemical systems. The curriculum also focuses on the quantitative aspects of chemistry, including **stoichiometry**, **reactions in aqueous solutions**, and **redox reactions**. Through lectures and problem-solving exercises, students develop a strong working knowledge of fundamental chemical concepts and the ability to apply them to solve a variety of problems.

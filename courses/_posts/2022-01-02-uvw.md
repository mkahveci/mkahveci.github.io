## Course Description
This course builds upon the foundational principles of General Chemistry A, with a focus on integrating multiple perspectives of matter to explain its properties and behavior. The curriculum covers key topics such as **liquids and solids**, **solutions**, **reaction kinetics**, and **chemical equilibria**. Students delve into the principles of **acids and bases**, explore **reaction thermodynamics**, and gain an understanding of **electrochemical reactions**. A central goal is to enhance students' skills in **scientific problem-solving** and **critical thinking**. Through in-depth conceptual integration, students learn to synthesize information and apply chemical principles to new situations. The course aims to deepen their understanding of how these chemical concepts manifest in the world around them.

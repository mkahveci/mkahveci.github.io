## Course Description
This graduate-level course provides a comprehensive survey of **scientific research methods** and **advanced statistical concepts** for the social and behavioral sciences. Students learn to apply statistical reasoning to research questions, covering both descriptive and inferential statistics. Key topics include measures of **central tendency and dispersion**, various **correlation techniques**, and statistical hypothesis testing using methods such as **t-tests and ANOVA**. The curriculum also explores more advanced multivariate techniques, including **regression analysis** and **factor analysis**. A practical component of the course involves hands-on data analysis using statistical software like **SPSS**. The overall goal is to equip students with the skills to design and conduct research, analyze data, and interpret findings with a high degree of statistical rigor.

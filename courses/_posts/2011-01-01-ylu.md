## Course Description

This course is a capstone experience for prospective chemistry educators, providing a structured environment for them to apply and refine their pedagogical skills in a real-world classroom setting. Students will be placed in a K-12 school to observe, assist, and eventually lead instruction under the supervision of an experienced mentor teacher and a university supervisor. The course focuses on a cyclical process of practice, observation, and feedback. Key areas of focus include lesson planning, classroom management, assessment strategies, and differentiated instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners. Regular reflective sessions and a final teaching portfolio are required to demonstrate professional growth and mastery of teaching standards.

## Course Description

This inquiry-based, hands-on **Skyline Physics** course moves beyond formula memorization to explore the fundamental principles governing the universe by investigating real-world phenomena. The curriculum is structured around big questions, such as how to design a thrilling roller coaster, protect athletes from concussions, and enable a phone to send pictures across the world. The course is aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).

Students act as scientists and engineers, developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for college and future careers. Key topics range from **motion, energy, and forces** (including Newton's Laws and conservation principles) to **waves, electricity, magnetism, and quantum mechanics**. Learning activities emphasize **collaborative projects, laboratory experiments, and engineering design challenges**, which require students to develop models, plan investigations, analyze data, and construct evidence-based explanations and solutions for real-world engineering challenges.

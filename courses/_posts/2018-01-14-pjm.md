## Course Description
This innovative laboratory course provides hands-on experience in **computational chemistry**, complementing theoretical concepts from lecture. Students utilize **deMon software** to perform a series of experiments that explore key principles of quantum mechanics and molecular structure. The curriculum covers topics such as the **vibrations of diatomic molecules**, the **Schrödinger equation**, and the properties of **atomic orbitals**. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to **Hückel molecular orbital theory**, where students investigate the stability of conjugated systems, bond order, and charge order. The course also includes a practical application of these concepts in **geometry optimization**. Students collaborate in lab groups and are required to submit original, detailed lab reports, equipping them with both computational skills and proficiency in scientific writing.

## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course reinforces the theoretical concepts of General Chemistry III by providing students with a practical, experience-based understanding of scientific inquiry. Students learn to **pose meaningful questions** and **formulate testable hypotheses** through a series of experiments. The curriculum focuses on developing essential laboratory skills, including **data analysis**, proper technique, and the use of scientific tools. Students work collaboratively to design and conduct investigations, gathering relevant data to test and revise their hypotheses. A key component of the course is the development of **scientific writing skills** through the preparation of formal laboratory reports. The goal is to equip students with the ability to communicate scientific procedures, results, and evidence-based arguments clearly and effectively.

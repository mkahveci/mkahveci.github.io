## Course Description
This course is the first in a two-part general chemistry sequence that surveys the foundational concepts and principles of chemistry. It focuses on developing a conceptual understanding of **atomic and molecular interactions** and how they manifest in the real world. Students learn to use **stoichiometry**, chemical logic, and reasoning to solve problems involving mass, moles, and molecules. The curriculum also covers **periodic trends** to predict elemental properties and delves into the **electronic structure** of atoms and molecules to understand their impact on chemical bonding and reactivity. The course emphasizes developing **problem-solving skills** by utilizing mathematical equations, and by reading and interpreting graphs and tables. The goal is to equip students with the ability to apply fundamental chemical concepts to evaluate real-world problems.

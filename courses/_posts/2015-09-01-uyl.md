## Course Description
This graduate-level course provides an in-depth exploration of the **philosophy and nature of scientific knowledge** and its critical role in **scientific literacy**. The curriculum delves into the theoretical foundations of science, its goals, and its relationship with technology, society, and the environment. Students examine various **epistemological approaches** to understanding scientific concepts and knowledge, and they learn how to translate these abstract ideas into practical **classroom instruction**. The course emphasizes interactive learning, with a focus on developing in-class activities and critically evaluating instructional materials. By the end of the course, students are able to articulate a well-defined understanding of the nature of science and apply this knowledge to enhance their pedagogical practices.

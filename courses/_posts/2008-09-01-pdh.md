## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to **social science research methodology**, focusing on the principles of **behavioral research** and **applied research designs** relevant to science education. The goal is to move beyond a simple list of methods, empowering students to develop a comprehensive philosophy for conducting research. Key topics include **empirical research methods**, research terminology, and the assessment of research's benefits in an educational context. A core component involves hands-on experience through **field trips**, where students collect and analyze data using basic statistical techniques. The course emphasizes the scientific reporting of findings and encourages a collaborative environment where students can refine their understanding and approach to research through professional class participation and constructive group work.

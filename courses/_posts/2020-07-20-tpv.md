## Course Description
This course provides a virtual laboratory experience to reinforce concepts from General Chemistry II lectures. Students perform a series of virtual experiments covering a variety of topics, including **gas chromatography, reaction kinetics**, and **qualitative analysis of anions**. The curriculum also explores key principles of **acid-base chemistry, buffer solutions**, and **Le Châtelier’s Principle**. Through these simulations, students gain practical experience in data analysis, observation, and understanding of experimental procedures. The course also delves into **thermodynamics, electrochemistry**, and **coordination chemistry**, preparing students to interpret and report on their findings in laboratory reports. The overall objective is to equip students with a solid foundation in experimental chemistry and scientific inquiry, even in a virtual environment.

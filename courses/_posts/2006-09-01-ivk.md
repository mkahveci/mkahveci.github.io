## Course Description
This graduate-level course offers a comprehensive theoretical and practical foundation for conducting qualitative research in science and mathematics education. It covers the **core principles, traditions, and research designs** that underpin this methodology. Key topics include fieldwork, data collection techniques such as creating field notes and interview transcripts, and various methods for data analysis. A central component of the course is a **field study**, where students apply their knowledge to collect, analyze, and report findings in an academic paper and presentation. Through active class discussions and critical evaluations of existing research, students develop a deep understanding of ethical practices and gain the ability to conduct and critique qualitative research projects effectively.

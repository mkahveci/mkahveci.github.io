## Course Description

This course introduces pre-service teachers to the fundamental principles of integrating technology into education and the theories of instructional material design. Students will explore a range of educational technologies, from basic presentation software to advanced digital learning platforms, and learn how to select and use them to enhance teaching and learning. The course covers key design theories and models, such as ADDIE and Merrill's First Principles of Instruction, with a focus on creating effective, engaging, and accessible learning materials. Practical projects will require students to develop their own technology-infused lesson plans and digital resources, preparing them to innovate in modern classroom environments.

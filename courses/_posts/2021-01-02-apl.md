## Course Description
This course is the second in a three-quarter sequence, providing a fundamental understanding of key general chemistry concepts. The curriculum explores **thermochemistry**, including the **laws of thermodynamics, enthalpy, and heats of reaction**. Students learn about the **properties of gases, liquids, and solids**, as well as the behavior of **solutions**. The course delves into **chemical kinetics**, covering topics such as reaction rates, rate laws, and reaction mechanisms. The final section introduces the principles of **chemical equilibrium**, including the **equilibrium constant, reaction quotient, and Le Châtelier’s principle**. A major goal is to help students develop problem-solving and critical-thinking skills through extensive practice and application of these principles.

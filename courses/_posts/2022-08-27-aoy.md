## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course reinforces the theoretical concepts of general chemistry by introducing **foundational chemical laboratory skills** and **analytical techniques**. A significant emphasis is placed on **lab safety**, including proper attire and equipment usage. Students gain practical experience with a variety of laboratory equipment and glassware while applying concepts such as **net ionic equations, pH, and enthalpy** to real-world experiments. The curriculum also introduces basic **statistical analysis** and **spectrophotometry**. A key component is the use of a non-erasable pen to maintain a lab notebook, reinforcing the importance of clear, accurate record-keeping. The overall goal is to equip students with the practical skills and knowledge necessary to conduct experiments safely and accurately.

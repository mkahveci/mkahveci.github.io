## Course Description
This is the third course in the general chemistry sequence, providing a fundamental understanding of advanced chemical concepts. The curriculum covers core topics such as **acid-base and solubility equilibria**, **thermodynamics**, and **electrochemistry**. Students also explore the principles of **radioactivity** and **coordination chemistry**. A major goal of the course is to develop **problem-solving and critical-thinking skills**, encouraging students to approach challenges from first principles and deeply understand their results. The course requires a significant time commitment to work through online assignments and textbook problems, fostering independent learning. The overall objective is to equip students with the knowledge and analytical abilities to solve complex chemical problems.

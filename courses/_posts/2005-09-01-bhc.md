## Course Description
This course challenges preservice teachers to develop a comprehensive, research-based philosophy for teaching secondary school physics. It moves beyond a simple list of lesson plans to foster a deep understanding of how students learn, considering the cognitive, social, and cultural factors that influence the learning process. Students analyze current science education research to inform their professional approach and refine their own teaching practices. The course provides opportunities to design and critique physics curricula, equipping students with the skills to plan effective classroom experiences that support learning in diverse student populations. The primary goal is to empower future educators with the knowledge and tools to create a coherent and informed professional stance on teaching physics.

## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the **fundamental concepts of chemistry**, designed for students with limited or no prior chemistry background. The curriculum focuses on essential topics such as the **properties of matter**, **units and conversions**, and **chemical bonding**. Students learn to write **chemical formulas** and **balanced chemical equations** and apply principles of **stoichiometry** to chemical calculations. The course also covers **atomic theory**, the organization of the **periodic table**, and an introduction to **thermochemistry**. The primary objective is to develop the core skills and abilities necessary for success in subsequent chemistry courses, while also fostering an appreciation for the relevance of chemistry in daily life.

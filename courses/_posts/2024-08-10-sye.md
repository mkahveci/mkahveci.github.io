## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to the **study of matter and its changes** through a focus on real-world applications. Students explore core chemical concepts by investigating **driving questions** related to everyday phenomena, such as thermal energy, rusting, and the function of food. The curriculum, aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards, emphasizes hands-on **laboratory experiments**, collaborative activities, and research-based learning. Students learn to apply chemical principles to topics ranging from the design of airbags to the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions. The course also addresses the ethical implications of chemical technologies, such as nuclear reactions. The overall goal is to equip students with a foundational understanding of chemistry and the skills to connect chemical concepts to their academic and personal lives.

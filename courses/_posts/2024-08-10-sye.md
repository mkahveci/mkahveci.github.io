# Course Description

Welcome to Chemistry! This course is aligned with the Skyline Curriculum and focuses on the study of matter and the changes it undergoes. Through hands-on laboratory experiments, collaborative activities, and research-based learning, students will explore key concepts in chemistry while emphasizing practical applications in real-world contexts.

The course integrates the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) with components of the College Readiness Standards and the Common Core State Standards for reading and writing. It is designed for sophomore students, offering 0.5 credits per semester (1 credit per year), and provides a foundation in chemistry to support both academic and personal growth.

## Materials

The following materials are required for the course:
- **Notebook**
- **Writing Utensils**
- **Scientific Calculator** (e.g., TI-30X or TI-84 for advanced functionality)

Class resources and assignments will be managed via **Google Classroom**.

## Classroom Policies

- **Conduct**: Students are expected to maintain respect, integrity, and active engagement. Cheating or disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.
- **Attendance and Absences**: Students are responsible for catching up on missed work outside of class time.
- **Homework and Late Work**: Late work is penalized at 50% and will not be accepted after the unit ends.
- **Extra Credit**: Offered sparingly and at the teacher’s discretion.

## Safety Agreement

Students must adhere to strict safety guidelines during laboratory activities, including:
- Wearing proper protective equipment.
- Following all instructions carefully.
- Avoiding unauthorized experiments and unsafe behaviors.

Both students and guardians are required to sign a safety agreement to participate in laboratory activities.

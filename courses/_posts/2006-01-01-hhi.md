## Course Description
This seminar offers preservice physics teachers a critical and collaborative space to refine their instructional abilities and develop a professional teaching style. Students engage in a process of reflection on their practical teaching experiences, sharing and receiving feedback from peers and the instructor. The course focuses on integrating cognitive principles into lesson planning and implementation, equipping students with a variety of instructional strategies for effective physics teaching. It is designed as a dynamic, interactive environment where class participation and constructive peer feedback are central to developing organizational and instructional skills. The goal is to move beyond passive learning, fostering a professional community of practice where students can critically analyze their own and others' teaching methods to become more effective educators.

## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course introduces foundational chemical laboratory skills and techniques, complementing the theoretical concepts from the lecture course. A strong emphasis is placed on **lab and chemical safety**, as well as the proper use of glassware and lab equipment. Students apply principles from lecture through experiments covering topics such as **atomic structure, periodic trends, solution preparation, stoichiometry, and titration**. The curriculum also introduces analytical techniques like **spectrophotometry** and **pH measurements**. Students learn to perform calculations, analyze data, and document their work meticulously in a lab notebook. A central goal is to develop **scientific writing skills** through the preparation of formal lab reports, which require students to explain their results and demonstrate an overall understanding of the experiments.

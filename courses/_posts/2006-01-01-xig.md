## Course Description
This course provides preservice teachers with an opportunity to reflect on and refine their approach to teaching secondary school science through **laboratory applications**. The focus is on moving beyond rote procedures to develop a philosophy of teaching that is informed by current research on how students learn science. Students explore the **cognitive principles and guidelines** for science instruction, using this foundation to design and critique effective laboratory curricula. The course is a highly interactive, collaborative seminar where students develop and practice their organizational and instructional skills. Through group work and discussions, students gain experience in planning meaningful, student-centered laboratory experiences and developing a professional, research-based stance on science education.

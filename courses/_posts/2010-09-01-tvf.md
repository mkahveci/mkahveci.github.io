## Course Description
This course provides a critical examination of modern physics topics and their application in elementary science education through an **inquiry-based teaching method**. It covers a range of contemporary topics, including semiconductors, lasers, superconductors, and nanotechnology, focusing on how these can be integrated into the curriculum. The primary goal is to help students develop a deep understanding of inquiry-based methods and apply them to physics instruction. Students enhance their pedagogical skills by designing lessons that are consistent with this approach. The course also includes activities focused on reading and critically analyzing **inquiry-based research** to help students develop a pedagogically supported approach to teaching physics.

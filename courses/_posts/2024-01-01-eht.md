## Course Description

This course is the second semester of undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory and is designed to build foundational knowledge and proficiency in essential lab skills. Students will conduct a variety of hands-on and virtual experiments to synthesize, isolate, purify, and characterize organic compounds. A major focus of the laboratory work is the identification of unknown compounds using spectroscopic data, including NMR and IR spectroscopy, to reinforce concepts from the companion lecture course (CHEM 224). The course emphasizes safe laboratory practices, accurate data recording, proper use of instrumentation, and scientific communication through detailed lab notebooks and formal reports. This course is primarily for non-chemistry majors and prepares students to apply organic chemistry principles in various scientific fields.

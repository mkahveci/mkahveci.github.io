## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course reinforces concepts from General Chemistry II lectures by providing an experience-based approach to scientific inquiry. Students learn to **pose scientific questions** and **generate testable hypotheses** through a series of experiments. The curriculum focuses on developing essential laboratory skills, including **accurate technique**, **data analysis**, and **error recognition**. Students work collaboratively to design and conduct investigations, gathering relevant data to test and revise their hypotheses. A key component of the course is the development of **scientific writing skills** through the preparation of formal laboratory reports. The primary objective is to equip students with the ability to communicate scientific procedures, results, and evidence-based arguments clearly and effectively.

## Course Description
This introductory course provides a comprehensive foundation in **social science research methodology**, with a particular emphasis on its application in science and mathematics education. It moves beyond a simple overview of research methods to help students develop a practical approach to conducting educational research. The course covers key concepts in **behavioral research** and introduces various **applied research designs**. Students gain hands-on experience by conducting **field trips** and analyzing the resulting data using basic statistical techniques. Through this process, students develop skills in data collection, analysis, and scientific reporting of findings. The goal is to cultivate a research philosophy that is both informed by current academic practices and grounded in the student's own evolving understanding of the field.

## Course Description

This graduate-level course provides an in-depth survey of quantitative research methods and advanced statistical concepts, with a particular emphasis on their application within the social and behavioral sciences. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of statistical analysis, from foundational descriptive statistics—such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation)—to more complex inferential techniques. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including correlation and regression, statistical hypothesis testing, and various forms of analysis of variance (ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA). The course also introduces nonparametric statistical methods, reliability analysis, and the fundamentals of sampling and statistical power. Through hands-on practice using statistical software like SPSS, students will develop the skills necessary to design quantitative research studies, conduct sophisticated data analysis, and interpret findings for academic publication and professional practice.

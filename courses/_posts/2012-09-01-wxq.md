## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the foundational principles of chemistry and their relevance to everyday life. The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, starting with **basic concepts of matter, elements, and compounds**, before delving into the **structure of the atom**, including atomic models, quantum theory, and the periodic table. Students explore the nature of **chemical bonds**, including theories of bonding and exceptions to the octet rule. The course also examines the properties and **states of matter**, such as gases, liquids, and solids, and introduces fundamental concepts in nuclear chemistry, including radioactivity. The overall goal is for students to apply these core principles to understand and explain chemical phenomena and their applications.

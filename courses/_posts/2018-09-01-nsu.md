## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course trains students in the application of **quantitative chemical techniques** to solve practical analytical problems. The curriculum begins with foundational exercises focused on **quantitative uncertainty**, **linear data modeling**, and solution preparation. Following this, students perform a series of five experiments, both individually and in small groups, covering topics such as **spectrophotometric measurements, iodimetric titrations**, and the analysis of acid-base titration curves. A strong emphasis is placed on developing professional laboratory skills, including maintaining a clear lab notebook, **processing data using spreadsheet software** (e.g., Microsoft Office), and creating well-formatted reports with figures and data tables. The overall goal is to equip students with the practical skills and analytical rigor necessary for accurate and precise chemical analysis.

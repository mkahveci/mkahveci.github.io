## Course Description
This graduate-level course provides a foundational and practical understanding of research methods for students in the social and behavioral sciences. It is designed to equip students with the necessary skills to design, conduct, and report on their own educational research. The course covers a range of **empirical research methods** and introduces fundamental **research terminology**. A key component of the curriculum is a **small-scale research project**, in which students gain hands-on experience through **field trips**, site visits, data collection, and analysis. This practical approach helps students to not only understand the mechanics of research but also to develop a personal philosophy and comprehensive approach to conducting scientific inquiry in education.

## Course Description

Physical Chemistry I (Thermodynamics) (CHEM 421A) is a comprehensive course designed to explore the principles of physical chemistry, particularly focusing on the aspects governing equilibria and reaction rates in chemical systems. The course begins with foundational topics, covering the fundamentals of physical chemistry, before delving into the detailed properties of gases. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics, providing a deep understanding of energy transformation and conservation in chemical processes. Students also explore chemical and phase equilibria, with a focus on the kinetic theory of gases. The course intricately discusses physical transitions in pure substances and behavior in simple mixtures. A substantial segment of the curriculum is devoted to chemical equilibrium, imparting knowledge about the balance between reactants and products in chemical reactions. The course concludes with an in-depth analysis of chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics, emphasizing the mechanisms and rates of chemical reactions. The textbook used for this course is "Physical Chemistry" (9th edition) by Atkins and Paula, a renowned resource in the field. This course is vital for students seeking a thorough understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic principles of physical chemistry.

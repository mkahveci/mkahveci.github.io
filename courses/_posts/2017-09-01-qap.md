## Course Description
This comprehensive course explores the core principles of **physical chemistry**, focusing on the fundamental concepts that govern **chemical and physical equilibria** and **reaction rates**. The curriculum begins with the foundational properties of gases and delves deeply into the three laws of **thermodynamics**, providing a robust understanding of energy, entropy, and spontaneous processes. Key topics include the kinetic theory of gases, **physical transitions in pure substances**, and the behavior of simple mixtures. A significant portion of the course is dedicated to **chemical equilibrium** and **reaction kinetics**, exploring the factors that influence reaction rates and the dynamics of chemical processes. The overall goal is to equip students with a thorough theoretical understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic principles that are vital to the field of physical chemistry.

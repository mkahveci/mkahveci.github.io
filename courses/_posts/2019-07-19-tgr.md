## Course Description
This preparatory course covers the **fundamental principles of chemistry** necessary for success in more advanced general chemistry sequences. The curriculum includes a wide range of topics, such as **atomic structure, chemical formulas, and stoichiometry**. Students also explore **chemical bonding, molecular shapes, gas laws, and solution chemistry**. A central goal of the course is to develop **problem-solving and critical-thinking skills** through extensive practice with assignments and textbook problems. The course encourages students to work through problems from first principles to gain a deep understanding of their results. The overall objective is to equip students with a solid foundation in chemical concepts and the analytical abilities needed to excel in future scientific studies.

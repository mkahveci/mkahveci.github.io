## Course Description

Chemical Reactivity I (CHEM 180) is an advanced course in a series designed to develop foundational knowledge and proficiency in key chemistry concepts and skills. The course encompasses a broad range of topics including acids and bases, buffers, chemical equilibrium, molecular thermodynamics and kinetics, and nucleophilic substitutions. Additionally, it covers elimination reactions, carbonyl compounds, and their relevance to biochemical pathways. The course integrates both historical and current developments in chemistry, addressing real-world problems and incorporating themes such as Structure-Activity Relationships, the culture and practice of science, energy, and polymers, proteins, and macromolecules.

## Learning Outcomes

The course emphasizes understanding, prediction, investigation, explanation, and evaluation over memorization. Students will enhance their problem-solving skills, develop the ability to make evidence-based claims, and learn to use and understand models and their limitations. The course also focuses on effective communication of scientific results. By the end of the course, students will be able to describe and explain molecular structure and stability, draw and interpret structures depicting reactivity, predict and draw reaction products, propose reaction mechanisms, and apply chemical principles to explain natural phenomena.

## Required Course Materials

The course requires WileyPlus (accessible through Sakai), a Molecular Model Kit (Duluth Labs MM-005 or equivalent), a non-programmable scientific calculator, and access to the Loyola Sakai course management site and Loyola email. Additional web-based systems like Gradescope may be used for uploading work and feedback.

## Course Description
This foundational course introduces core concepts and skills essential for success in chemistry. It focuses on **atomic structure, periodic properties, and the characteristics of chemical bonding**, and examines the **properties of molecules and solid-state materials**. The curriculum is designed to move beyond memorization, emphasizing **problem-solving, critical thinking, and the use of scientific models**. Students learn to differentiate types of matter and use multiple perspectives—macroscopic, particle, and symbolic—to describe and explain chemical systems. The course integrates historical and current developments in chemistry, connecting foundational knowledge to real-world problems. The overall goal is to equip students with the ability to make claims based on evidence, use models to make predictions, and effectively communicate scientific results.

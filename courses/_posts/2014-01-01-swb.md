## Course Description
This course is the second part of a two-semester sequence that builds on the foundational principles of chemistry. It provides a deeper understanding of chemical concepts and their **real-world applications**. Key topics include the properties and preparation of **solutions**, as well as the laws governing **chemical kinetics** and **equilibrium**. Students learn about **acids and bases**, including pH, buffer solutions, and titration. The curriculum also introduces the fundamental principles of **thermodynamics**, such as enthalpy, entropy, and free energy, and explores **electrochemistry**, covering concepts like electrolysis and Faraday's law. By examining these topics, the course aims to equip students with a robust knowledge of advanced chemical principles and the ability to apply them to solve a variety of problems.

## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental principles of general chemistry, framing chemistry not as a rigid set of rules, but as a dynamic, evolving science. The curriculum covers key topics such as **chemical formulas and equations, acids and bases, thermochemistry, and atomic and molecular theory**. A significant emphasis is placed on developing **problem-solving skills** and **inductive reasoning**, encouraging students to build abstract models and apply their understanding to novel situations. The course is designed to be highly interactive, utilizing **visual aids, examples, and problem-solving sessions** to accommodate various learning styles. The primary goal is to guide students toward a deeper, more conceptual understanding of chemistry, empowering them to synthesize their own knowledge and become effective problem solvers for both this course and future studies.

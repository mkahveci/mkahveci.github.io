## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to biology, focusing on the study of **living organisms and their interactions with the environment**. The curriculum is structured around a series of **driving questions** that connect key biological concepts to real-world issues, such as disease, diet, evolution, and ecology. Students engage in **hands-on laboratory experiments, model-based learning, and collaborative projects** to explore topics like genetic diseases, species evolution, and sustainable food systems. The course emphasizes practical applications and critical thinking, encouraging students to make informed decisions on complex biological and ecological issues. The overall goal is to equip students with a strong foundation in biology and the skills to understand the living world around them.

# Course Description

Welcome to Biology! This course is structured around the Skyline Curriculum and focuses on the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. Students will explore key biological concepts through hands-on laboratory experiments, model-based learning, collaborative activities, and research projects. Emphasizing the practical application of biology, this course aims to help students understand the living world and make informed decisions on ecological and biological issues.

The course is designed to align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and incorporates elements of the College Readiness Standards and the Common Core State Standards for reading and writing. Sophomore students will earn 0.5 credits per semester (1 credit per year) toward their graduation requirements, building a strong foundation in biology for academic and personal development.

## Materials

Students are required to have the following materials:
- **Notebook**
- **Writing utensils**
- **Scientific Calculator**  
  Recommended options:
    - TI-30X (~$10–$15)
    - TI-84 (graphing calculator with advanced functionality)

All class resources, announcements, and assignments will be managed through **Google Classroom**.

- **Homework and Late Work**: Late work is penalized at 50% and will not be accepted after the unit ends.
- **Extra Credit**: Opportunities are provided sparingly.

## Science Safety Agreement

Students must adhere to laboratory safety protocols, including:
- Following all instructions and using equipment properly.
- Wearing appropriate protective gear.
- Avoiding unauthorized experiments and unsafe behavior.
- Reporting any accidents or unsafe conditions to the teacher immediately.

Both students and guardians are required to sign a safety agreement before participating in laboratory activities.

## Course Description
This course introduces fundamental principles of chemistry with a specific focus on their **applications in engineering science**. It provides a multi-perspective approach to understanding matter, covering a range of topics including **solutions, reaction kinetics, equilibria, acids, bases, and thermodynamics**. The curriculum is designed to enhance **scientific problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and the synthesis of concepts**. Students learn to describe and explain chemical systems from macroscopic, particle, and symbolic perspectives. The course emphasizes the ability to solve complex, multi-step quantitative problems and apply chemical principles to natural phenomena. The overall goal is to equip future engineers with a strong conceptual and practical foundation in chemistry.

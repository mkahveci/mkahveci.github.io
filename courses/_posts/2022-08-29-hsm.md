## Course Description

General Chemistry for Engineering (CHEM 171) is designed to introduce students to fundamental concepts of chemistry with a focus on their applications in engineering science. The course offers a multi-perspective approach to understanding matter, covering topics such as atoms and molecules, solutions, reaction kinetics, equilibria, acids and bases, reaction thermodynamics, and electrochemical reactions. Students will enhance their scientific problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and synthesis of concepts. They will learn to use different perspectives of matter (macroscopic, particle, symbolic) to qualitatively describe and explain the characteristics and properties of various chemical systems, quantify relationships between variables, solve quantitative multistep problems, differentiate among related factors, and apply chemical principles to natural phenomena. 

## Textbook and Materials

The required textbook is “Chemistry for Engineering Students” (4th edition) by Larry Brown and Tom Holme, ISBN 978-1-337-39890-9. The Student Solutions Manual with Study Guide, ISBN 978-1-337-39906-7 is also recommended. Lecture notes and handouts will be provided electronically, with students expected to actively participate in note-taking during lectures. 

## Other Materials

Students will need a basic calculator capable of logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric functions. Familiarity with the calculator is essential for quizzes and exams, where calculators cannot be shared and cell phones are not permitted.

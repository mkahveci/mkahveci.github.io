## Course Description

This is a directed research course designed for graduate students to conduct independent, in-depth research under the direct supervision of a faculty member. The course provides students with the opportunity to immerse themselves in an authentic research project, which can include a literature review, experimental design, data collection, analysis, and the preparation of a final report or manuscript. This experience allows students to apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems while developing critical skills in scientific inquiry, project management, and professional communication. The specific research topic is determined in collaboration with the instructor, tailored to the studentâ€™s interests and academic goals.

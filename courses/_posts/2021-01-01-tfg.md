## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course reinforces **general chemistry concepts** through a series of experiments. The curriculum focuses on developing essential laboratory skills such as **data analysis, proper technique, and accuracy**. Students explore a variety of topics, including **density and volumetric measurements**, **Avogadro's number**, and the **empirical formula of a compound**. The course also introduces core concepts like **spectroscopy, qualitative analysis**, and **titration** through practical applications. A key objective is to develop **scientific writing skills** through the preparation of detailed laboratory reports, which are assessed based on preparedness, technique, and overall understanding. The primary goal is to provide students with the practical experience and analytical rigor necessary to succeed in future science courses.

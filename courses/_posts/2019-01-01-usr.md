## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental chemistry principles, preparing students for further studies in chemistry and related fields. It covers core topics such as **properties of matter, atomic theory, nomenclature, and chemical bonding**. The curriculum also delves into **chemical reactions and stoichiometry, thermochemistry, and gas and solution chemistry**. The course is structured to develop intellectual and laboratory skills through a variety of instructional methods, including traditional lectures, class discussions, and hands-on laboratory work. A key focus is on helping students connect the three "languages" of chemistry—the nanoscopic, macroscopic, and mathematical—to enhance their **problem-solving skills** and logical thinking. The overall goal is to equip students with a robust foundation in chemical principles and the ability to apply them to new situations.

## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course complements theoretical physical chemistry concepts by focusing on the principles that govern **equilibria and reaction rates**. Students engage in a series of experiments that provide practical experience with topics such as **thermodynamic properties, thermochemistry, and chemical and phase equilibria**. Specific labs involve determining the **heat capacity of gases**, measuring **heats of combustion**, and analyzing **partial molar volume**. The curriculum also covers the determination of the **acid dissociation constant (pKa)** and the application of **cyclic voltammetry**. The course culminates with experiments on **reaction kinetics**, allowing students to gain valuable laboratory skills and a deeper understanding of the practical aspects of physical chemistry principles.

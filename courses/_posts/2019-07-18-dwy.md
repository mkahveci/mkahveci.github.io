## Course Description
This hands-on laboratory course reinforces **basic chemical concepts** from lectures through a series of experiments. Students engage in **experience-based investigations** to understand how science functions as a mechanism for inquiry into the natural world. The curriculum is designed to develop core scientific skills, including **posing meaningful questions**, generating **testable hypotheses**, and **planning and conducting investigations** in a collaborative setting. Students learn to use scientific models, analyze data variability, and communicate their procedures, results, and explanations through formal **laboratory reports**. The course places a strong emphasis on developing **scientific writing skills**, requiring students to produce well-structured reports that integrate data analysis and evidence-based arguments. The primary goal is to train students in the fundamental processes of scientific inquiry.

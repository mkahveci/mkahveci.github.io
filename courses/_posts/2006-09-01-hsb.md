## Course Description

SCED 420 is meant to provide students with theoretical and conceptual approaches to teaching and learning process. The scope of the class includes teaching methods, strategies, techniques and principles specific to the area of science education.

## Course Goals

The focus of the course will be:

* to obtain the theoretical background on the basic assumptions, concepts, and principles of each learning theory
* to establish the possible implications of each theory for instructional settings,
* to discuss your own learning theory and compare it with the learning theories,
* to revise and critique your own theory at the end of the class.

## Course Expectations

This is not a purely lecture class and information cannot be simply obtained by “getting the notes” from a classmate. You are to read the assignments that are posted to the class web site before coming to class and be ready for discussion. Therefore, attendance is expected and you are to be professional in your class participation. Professionalism includes, but is not limited to, such things as excellence in class assignments, constructive class participation, being a positive contributor to group work, taking advantage of opportunities to broaden personal knowledge and skills, and going beyond the minimum in all your work and interactions.

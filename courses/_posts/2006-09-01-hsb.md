## Course Description
This course examines theoretical and conceptual approaches to teaching and learning in science and mathematics education. It delves into various learning theories, exploring their fundamental assumptions, concepts, and principles. The primary goal is to help students analyze and establish the practical implications of these theories for instructional settings. The course is structured as a collaborative seminar where students actively discuss and critique their own evolving philosophies of teaching. Rather than a traditional lecture, it is a dynamic environment that encourages students to engage in critical reflection, group work, and constructive class participation. By the end of the course, students are able to articulate a coherent, informed teaching theory grounded in established educational principles.

Research in education indicates that there is not a settled view of what interactivity or interaction mean for learning and instruction. This book presents the research procedures and findings on the perceptions of the faculty members at colleges of education around the world about instructional interactivity, by specifically undertaking a comparative analysis of the key aspects surrounding the functional definitions of interactivity, the existence of interactivity in various instructional settings, the attributes of interactivity as a function of motivation and learning theories, and the events of interactivity to discern any relationships that might exist with respect to the eight predictors; gender, age, present status, highest degree obtained, geographic region, research interest in interactivity, personal learning preferences (the strength of the VARK score), and institutional department. This work included educational measurement in the form of valid and reliable instrument development, literature from many fields of education such as educational technology, educational measurement, psychology, science and mathematics education.

## Academic Highlights

I am currently a science teacher at Chicago Public Schools and an instructor of chemistry at Wheeling University, leveraging my dual expertise in K-12 and post-secondary education to inspire and engage diverse learners. My teaching focuses on student-centered approaches, inquiry-based laboratory exercises, and innovative integration of educational technology. Previously, I served as an instructor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Loyola University Chicago, where I actively engaged in chemistry education research (CER) and science education.

My research explores critical areas such as [affective dimensions](/yfg), [psychometric measurements](/auh), [educational technology](/oux), [instructional interactivity](/jzl), and [conceptual learning](/ekj). Using a combination of quantitative research methodologies and advanced statistical techniques, I develop tools and strategies to enhance science education globally. Highlights include contributions to "[Affective Dimensions in Chemistry Education](/yfg)," the development of innovative tools such as [graphical representations](/drc) for assessing conceptual understanding, and international collaborations on large-scale projects, publications, and book co-authorships, including [STPD](/oyc) and [PedDis](/auh).

I hold a Ph.D. in science education from Florida State University, along with M.S. degrees in physical chemistry and science education. My educational journey began with a B.S. in chemistry education from Gazi University, and I hold a professional educator license from the Illinois State Board of Education, with endorsements in advanced placement and honors chemistry.

I am passionate about fostering critical thinking and engagement among students across educational levels. At Chicago Public Schools, I utilize the Skyline science curriculum to enhance mastery of key concepts, while at Wheeling University, I teach foundational organic chemistry through dynamic virtual instruction. I am honored to be a [Scholarship for Teaching and Learning Scholar](/gde) and a member of the 2nd cohort of the Faculty Fellowship in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL) at Loyola University Chicago (2023-2025). My teaching and service projects include "[Enhancing General Chemistry Education](/thr)," "[Uncovering Misconceptions in Biochemistry](/ewm)," and "[Advancing Physical Chemistry Education](/lhu)."

I am excited to announce the acceptance of a new conference paper, "[Artificial Intelligence and Academic Integrity: Legislate or Educate?](/snu)," presented at the PUPP International Summit in Gatineau-Ottawa, Canada, May 21-24, 2024. This work reflects my ongoing commitment to advancing science education through cutting-edge research.

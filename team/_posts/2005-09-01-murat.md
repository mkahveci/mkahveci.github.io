As an Instructor within the <a class="off" href="https://www.luc.edu/chemistry/">Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</a> at Loyola University Chicago, I am engaged in research within the fields of Chemistry Education Research (CER) and Science Education. My research endeavors focus on the [affective dimensions](/yfg), [psychometric measurements](/auh), [educational technology](/oux), [instructional interactivity](/jzl), and [conceptual learning](/ekj) in the field of science education. I employ quantitative research methodologies and advanced inferential statistical techniques, particularly when working with large data sets such as the OECD’s [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/) database and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ([TIMSS](https://nces.ed.gov/timss/)).

I hold a Ph.D. in Science Education from Florida State University, as well as an M.S. in Physical Chemistry and Science Education from the same institution. Additionally, I have earned a B.S. in Chemistry Education from Gazi University and hold a Professional Educator License awarded by the Illinois State Board of Education. My notable research developments and publications can be found on my [blog](/blog), [publications](/papers), and [projects](/projects) pages. Furthermore, I am also engaged in international collaborations to develop large-scale projects and publish joint reports, which can be found on the [team](/team)'s page. It is my hope to expand upon these collaborative opportunities in the future.

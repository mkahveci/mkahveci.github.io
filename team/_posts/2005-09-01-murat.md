I am an Instructor of the <a class="off" href="https://www.luc.edu/chemistry/">Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</a> at <a class="off" href="https://www.luc.edu/">Loyola University Chicago</a>, and conduct research in the fields of Chemistry Education Research (CER) and Science Education. My research revolves around affective dimensions, psychometric measurements, educational technology, instructional interactivity, and conceptual learning. I mainly utilize quantitative research methodologies and employ advanced inferential statistics techniques, especially on large data sets such as OECD's [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/) database and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ([TIMSS](https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss-landing.html)). Noteworty developments are posted to the [blog](/blog), [publications](/papers), and [projects](/projects) pages. I do international collaborations to develop large scale projects and publish joint reports. Such collaborations are posted to the [team's](/team) page. I hope [kahveci.pw](/) will enlarge the future possibilities for such collaborations.

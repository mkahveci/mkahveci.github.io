As an Instructor within the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Loyola University Chicago, I am actively engaged in research within the fields of Chemistry Education Research (CER) and Science Education. My research focuses on [affective dimensions](/yfg), [psychometric measurements](/auh), [educational technology](/oux), [instructional interactivity](/jzl), and [conceptual learning](/ekj) in science education, employing quantitative research methodologies and advanced statistical techniques.

With a Ph.D. in Science Education from Florida State University and an M.S. in Physical Chemistry and Science Education, my extensive academic background equips me for my role. I also hold a B.S. in Chemistry Education from Gazi University and possess a Professional Educator License awarded by the Illinois State Board of Education.

My research contributions and publications can be found on my [blog](/blog), [publications](/papers), and [projects](/projects) pages pages, where you can explore my notable work. I am actively involved in international collaborations that aim to develop large-scale projects and publish joint reports such as [ADCE](), further extending our reach.

Notably, I have been selected as a [Scholarship for Teaching and Learning Scholar](/gde) and am part of the 2nd cohort for the Faculty Fellowship in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL) at Loyola University Chicago (2023-2025). Additionally, I am spearheading several innovative collaborative projects, including "[Enhancing General Chemistry Education](/thr)," "[Uncovering Misconceptions in Biochemistry](/ewm)," "[Advancing Physical Chemistry Education](/lhu)," and "[Investigating the Role of Artificial Intelligence Tools in Academic Integrity](bno)."

I am also pleased to announce the acceptance of a new conference paper titled "[Artificial Intelligence and Academic Integrity: Legislate or Educate?](/snu)" presented at the PUPP International Summit in Gatineau-Ottawa, Canada, from May 21 to 24, 2024. These developments reflect my commitment to the advancement of science education and the pursuit of innovative research.

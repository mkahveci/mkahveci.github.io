Dr. Xiang Wan is an applied mathematician specializing in Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). He holds a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, along with a M.S. from Auburn University and an undergraduate degree in mathematics from Beijing Jiaotong University. His research is two-fold, focusing on both the qualitative study of PDE systems—including mathematical modeling and control theory—and the numerical analysis of discrete schemes for PDEs. Before joining Loyola University Chicago in 2022, he held several post-doctoral and visiting positions at institutions like George Washington University and Wayne State University.

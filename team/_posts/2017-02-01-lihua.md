[Dr. Lihua Jin](https://csh.depaul.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-a-z/Pages/chemistry/lihua-jin.aspx) received her B.S. (1984) and M.S. (1987) in Chemistry from [Fudan University](www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in China and her Ph.D. (1996) from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). Her Ph.D. and postdoctoral training was on the study of protein structure-function relationships using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques including isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Her independent research started in 1999 as a faculty member working with undergraduates at the State University of [New York College at Geneseo](https://www.geneseo.edu/) (1999-2002) and later with both undergraduates and M.S. students at DePaul University (2002-present). At SUNY Geneseo her research was focused on the biochemical study of protein-lipid interactions in the context of lipoproteins.  At [DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu/) her research has been focused on the study of molecular interactions using ITC, specifically interactions involving protein-small molecule, protein-DNA, peptide-metal ions and small molecule-metal ions. Dr. Jin’s other research focus is in improving student learning.  She has collaborated with [Dr. Murat Kahveci](/team/murat-kahveci/), a chemistry education expert and adjunct faculty of [DePaul University](https://www.depaul.edu/), in the creation of two-tier diagnostic instrument to measure biochemistry course taker’s conceptual understanding.

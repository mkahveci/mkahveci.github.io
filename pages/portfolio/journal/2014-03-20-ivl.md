Two-stage stratified sampling strategy provided the sample for the analysis. Findings showed that

* boys have significantly higher mathematical self-efficacy, self-concept, motivation and lower mathematics anxiety than girls,
* students with higher socioeconomic status have higher self-efficacy, self-concept and motivation whereas students with the highest mathematics anxiety are in medium socioeconomic level, and
* self-efficacy, self-concept, motivation and anxiety differ significantly with respect to geographical regions.

This booklet presents the academic portfolio of the Kahveci Group at Loyola University Chicago. We are a research group working in the field of chemistry education research (CER).

If you are reading this document, it means you are interested in our work. We would like to share our expertise with public at large and therefore we devote our time to keep this document in great detail and up-to-date given the fast evolving changes happening day by day. We also value the opinions of the community and would like to hear your feedback.

We are aware that research in social and behavioral sciences varies by tradition. The Kahveci Group is no exception. While we utilize all kinds of research, we conduct basically quantitative research methodologies. Topic-wise, our work includes variety of themes however our group lately works at the interface of affective dimensions in chemistry education research. We develop and apply diagnostic tests and in depth surveys to gather quantitative data with the aim of understanding how learning complex chemistry topics is governed by the affective variables.

## Join

New ideas on joint research proposals and publications are welcome. We are eager to meet and collaborate with new researchers and research groups in the chemistry education domain.

## Publishers

We are always eager to publish our studies to reach out wider community across the globe. We would be happy to talk with the publishers in the field for our research outlet.

## Students

If you are in need of an external committee member for your Master's or doctoral research study, our group would be interested in discussing future possibilities.

Our group is interested in new members of undergraduate students, who are interested in chemistry education research. Learning chemistry is always exciting. Likewise, researching how different people learn chemistry is very exciting as well.

Sincerely,


Murat Kahveci, Ph.D.

[PChemLO](/vzm) project is a collaborative project between the Divisions of Chemistry Education and Physical Chemistry at Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University in Turkey. The main objectives of the project are to develop learning objects that are based on inquiry-based teaching principles and investigate student attitudes and motivation to utilize these learning objects. The project investigates male and female studentsâ€™ affective dimensions in using the online materials (i.e. learning objects) to learn advanced chemistry topics such as physical chemistry. By the implementation of technology into the inquiry-based science education as the teaching strategy may diminish the gender differences on learning science contents and using technology for learning. In this poster, the method to develop and implement learning objects in a physical chemistry course will be presented. In addition, benefits and disadvantages of using such systems with the gender differences perspective will be presented from relevant literature.

The difficulties of teaching large classes with the resulting limitations of face-to-face interaction between instructor and students have been long-term problems for chemistry teaching in college freshman chemistry classes. However, with the enhancement of technologies (e.g. World Wide Web (WWW), interactive compact disk technology, e-mail communications, etc.) at lower and lower costs, and by the use of these instructional technologies especially in high populated (over 150 students) freshman chemistry classes, overall interactivity necessary for viable knowledge construction increases. In this article, the theoretical significance of a technology enhanced General Chemistry course at a Southeastern University in the U.S. is discussed in terms of its various curricular elements in the frame of instructional interactivity.

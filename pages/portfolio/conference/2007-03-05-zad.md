These types include interaction between students, interaction between teacher and students, and interaction between students and leaning technology. In small cooperative groups, factors that affect interaction are as follows: group composition, type of interaction, effect of teacher, interdependence of students and nature of the task. Some teaching implications of the findings were discussed as follows: students should be encouraged to use multiple representations to develop problem solving strategies; students' motivation to learn should be mastery goal oriented, teachers should encourage student participation in classroom discussions; students should be expected to provide mathematical reasoning rather than producing the right answer; and design of tasks should be suitable to promote skills such as mathematical reasoning and metacognition.

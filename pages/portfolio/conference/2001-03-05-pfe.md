A web-based survey was used to gather data on diverse views of the academicians, researchers, and teachers. With the help of their answers and our own questioning, we were able to come up with a four-leave model for Interactivity, with social, intellectual, technical, and physical dimensions constituting the four leaves. We hope that this research would give an idea to teachers for what they should expect from "Interactivity" or not.

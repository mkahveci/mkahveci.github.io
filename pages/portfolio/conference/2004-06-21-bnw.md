The trend of the use of interactivity intensifies when content gets more abstract and instruction is delivered at a distance. Especially, teaching complex and abstract science concepts by the use of telecommunications technology signifies the meaning and appropriate levels of interactivity for instruction. However, definition and forms of interactivity are often confined by instructional mediums such as computer programs and telecommunications technologies. This article discusses the meaning of interactivity and levels of interactivity constructed in the education literature (in the field of computer-based instruction (CBI), cognitive science, and social science). It is concluded that the Spiral Dynamics (Beck & Cowan, 1996) can be considered as a comprehensive framework to base conceptual parameters for the operation of interactivity in terms of human psychology and ability of learning.

An increasing body of research indicates that female students are especially underrepresented in those fields. In this paper, we investigate the interactivity of female students with their instructors in the courses of science, mathematics, and engineering. Surveying high level of interactivity with the help of computer integration to the present curricula would indicate the female students' sustained interest and success in favor of those underrepresented fields.

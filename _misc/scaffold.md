This document is the central guide for creating all new content on this website. It details how to use the unified **`new.sh`** scaffolding script to automatically generate new, pre-filled posts for **projects, courses, blog posts, albums, and talks.**

The script streamlines the entire content creation process. It provides interactive prompts, handles automatic contributor linking, and generates the correct files and templates for each content type.


## 1\. How to Use the Scaffolding Script

The `scaffold.py` script is a single, interactive tool that replaces all the old, separate `.sh` files. It will ask you what you want to create and then prompt you for all the necessary information.

### Step 1: Run the Script

From the root directory of the website, run the new `new.sh` script:

{% highlight bash %}
{% raw %}

sh new.sh

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Step 2: Select a Post Type

You will see an interactive menu of all available post types.

{% highlight text %}
{% raw %}

Select a post type to create:

1.  Album
2.  Blog
3.  Course
4.  Project
5.  Talk
    Enter a number (1-5):

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Type the number for the content you want to create (e.g., `3` for a new Course) and press Enter.

### Step 3: Answer the Prompts

The script will guide you through a series of prompts to gather the necessary data. This includes:

* **Titles & Excerpts:** Basic post information.
* **Contributors:** For `project` and `talk` posts, you will see a numbered list of all team members. You can select them in the correct order (e.g., `2, 1, 3`).
* **Specific Data:** You'll be asked for unique fields, like a `Course Code` for a course or `Tags` for a blog post.

### Step 4: Get Your New File

Once you finish, the script will create the new file in the correct directory (e.g., `projects/_posts/`) with the correct file extension (`.html` for talks, `.md` for everything else), ready for you to add your content.

{% highlight text %}
{% raw %}

Success\! New post created at: projects/\_posts/2025-11-16-xyz.md

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## 2\. How Contributor Linking Works

For `project` and `talk` posts, the script automatically generates links for the contributors you select. This system works by:

1.  **Scanning `team/_posts/`:** It reads all your team member `.md` files to get their names and filenames.
2.  **Using the `name` field:** The link text is pulled from the `name:` field in the team member's YAML (e.g., `name: Murat Kahveci`).
3.  **Using the `file_slug`:** The link URL is built from the file's slug to match your site's `/:title/` permalink structure.
    * `murat-kahveci.md` becomes `[Murat Kahveci](/murat-kahveci/)`
    * `2024-01-01-annemarie-kegler.md` becomes `[Annemarie Kegler](/annemarie-kegler/)`

This ensures that as long as a team member has a file in `team/_posts/`, their link will be generated correctly without you having to add or maintain a `url:` field.

## 3\. Guide: `talk` Posts (Slides)

`talk` posts are saved as `.html` files in `talks/_posts/`. The script will prompt you for all the metadata needed for the title slide and automatically append the full slide deck template.

### 3.1 Front Matter (Generated)

This is the YAML front matter that will be automatically generated by the script.

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}

### 3.3 Content Slides

Use Markdown for your main content slides. Separate each slide with `---`.

**Standard Slide**
{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}

## 1\. Introduction & Background

* Use bullet points for key concepts.
* Keep text concise and to the point.
* You can use **bold** or *italic* formatting for emphasis.

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

**Fragmented Slide**
{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}

## 1\. The Challenge: Reaching Every Learner

\<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"\>
\<p\>\<strong\>Differentiation is complex.\</strong\> Creating materials for multiple proficiency levels for every lesson is incredibly time-consuming.\</p\>
\</div\>

\<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"\>
\<p\>\<strong\>Language is a barrier.\</strong\> Scaffolding complex texts, scientific jargon, and abstract concepts for our ELLs is a daily struggle.\</p\>
\</div\>

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

**Table Slide**
{% highlight liquid %}

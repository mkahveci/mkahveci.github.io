Having one session during three-day even was quite productive. You don't miss any seminars due to concurrent sessions. Excellent [campus](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/en/) and excellent organization. Many thanks to [Ingo Eilks](http://www.chemiedidaktik.uni-bremen.de/mitarbeiter_eng.php?id=89) and [Bernd Ralle](https://ccb.tu-dortmund.de/en/professorships/dc/ralle/), the co-organizers, for putting this program together and welcoming us individually. Too, I remember we travelled in-city for free by train! 

Personally, I had many good contacts during this meeting. Highly valuable contributions to [ADCE](/yfg) book from Germany was no by chance!

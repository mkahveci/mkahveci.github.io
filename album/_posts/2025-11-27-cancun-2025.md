We are spending this year's Thanksgiving break (November 23–29) in beautiful **Cancún, Mexico**, joined by my daughter, [Asel Müge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aselmuge/).

We are having a fantastic time here! The weather has been perfect—sunny days with temperatures that are ideal for sightseeing, enjoying local activities, and swimming in the ocean. Beyond the natural beauty, we have been deeply impressed by the rich culture and the incredible hospitality of the people here.

Yesterday (November 26), we had an action-packed day at **Aquaworld**. We participated in two major highlights:
1.  **The Jungle Tour:** A thrilling boat ride through the mangroves followed by snorkeling in the crystal-clear water.
2.  **The Waverider:** An exhilarating jetski tour across the open water.

Below, you can see a collection of moments from these adventures.

### The Journey Home: A Test of Patience

Our return journey on November 29 proved to be an adventure in itself, contrasting sharply with the relaxation of the week. We departed the hotel at 8:45 AM using [World2Meet](https://www.w2m.travel/en-en), who provided excellent service, getting us to the airport in just 20 minutes. Things looked promising when we received a free upgrade to a direct flight (replacing our original itinerary which had a 1 hour 15 minute layover), scheduled for 12:05 PM.

However, Chicago had other plans. A severe snowstorm resulted in over 800 flight cancellations back home. While we were lucky our flight wasn't cancelled, we spent over 7 hours in a very crowded terminal before finally departing at 4:45 PM. The challenges continued upon landing at O'Hare; with 10 aircraft ahead of us, we sat on the tarmac for over two hours before finally reaching the gate and the passport line. To top it off, the airport train service was halted, forcing us to switch terminals and take an expensive taxi ride home. We finally walked through our front door at 12:15 AM—exhausted, but incredibly happy to be home.

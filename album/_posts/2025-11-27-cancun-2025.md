We are spending this year's Thanksgiving break (November 23–29) in beautiful **Cancún, Mexico**, joined by my daughter, [Asel Müge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aselmuge/).

We are having a fantastic time here! The weather has been perfect—sunny days with temperatures that are ideal for sightseeing, enjoying local activities, and swimming in the ocean. Beyond the natural beauty, we have been deeply impressed by the rich culture and the incredible hospitality of the people here.

Yesterday (November 26), we had an action-packed day at **Aquaworld**. We participated in two major highlights:
1.  **The Jungle Tour:** A thrilling boat ride through the mangroves followed by snorkeling in the crystal-clear water.
2.  **The Waverider:** An exhilarating jetski tour across the open water.

Below, you can see a collection of moments from these adventures.

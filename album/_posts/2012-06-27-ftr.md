I was privileged to be at the [University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html) between 4/1/2012 and 6/30/2012 as a Visiting Professor. Many thanks to [Prof. Dr. Ulrich Gebhard](https://www.ew.uni-hamburg.de/ueber-die-fakultaet/personen/gebhard.html) for inviting me to join his research group.

It was a pleasure connecting with colleagues like [Prof. Dr. Arnie Dittmer](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/didaktik-biologie/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-arne-dittmer/index.html) and [Prof. Dr. Jürgen Menthe](https://www.uni-hildesheim.de/en/fb4/institutes/biologie/welcome-to-the-chemistry-department-university-hildesheim/the-team/prof-dr-juergen-menthe/) during my stay.

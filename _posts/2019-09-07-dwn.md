[Affective Dimensions in Chemistry Education](/yfg) was published in January 2015. Since then the book has received a number of citations, downloaded many times, and read by many scholars. This blog page updates these relevant stats.

This is a unique resource for those wishing to address the affective domain as they research and solve problems in chemistry education. Contributions by world-leading experts cover both fundamental considerations and practical case studies. This work fills a gap in the literature of chemistry education, which so far has focussed mainly on the cognitive domain. The affective domain refers to feelings-based constructs such as attitudes, values, beliefs, opinions, emotions, interests, motivation, and a degree of acceptance or rejection. It can affect studentsâ€™ interest in science topics and their motivation to persevere in learning science concepts.

## Goals

- Determine the moles of each pure liquid per unit area
 
$$ n_A = A_{i,l} \frac{V_l \rho_i}{M_i A^0_{i,l}} $$

- Determine the mole fraction of component A in the liquid phase
  
$$ \chi_A^l = \frac{n_A}{n_{\text{total}}} $$

- Determine the partial pressure of each component

$$ P_{i,v} = A_{i,v} \frac{P^0_i}{A^0_{i,v}} $$
 
- Generate the Raoult's law plot (see Figure 1 in the manual)

## Assignment

- Watch the Excel workshop video for calculations and plotting expectations.
- Download the students spreadsheet for the workshop and do step by step calculations in the workshop.
- Download the data set and do the same analysis.
- Upload the Worksheet in PDF format (download the template as MS Word file and fill it out by following the instructions).
- Upload all calculations and data tables in an MS Excel file.

## Q&As

### The area values for the pure substances

> I noticed that we did not have the area (pA * s) values for the pure substances. This value is necessary in order to begin calculations on the rest of the data. I have watched the lab introduction videos as well as your excel tutorial but I could not find this information and am hoping for some guidance to point me in the right direction.

These values can be extracted from the Liquid data (the first table) and Gas data (the second table) separately. So, we will read this information as follows:

* When Part A equals to 1.0, it is `pure pentane`. Pure pentane has both liquid and gas phases.
  * Liquid area: $ 5.10 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $
  * Gas area: $ 6.19 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $
* When Part A equals to 0.0, it is `pure hexane`. Pure hexane has both liquid and gas phases.
  * Liquid area: $ 6.57 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $
  * Gas area: $ 2.82 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $

### Pre/postlab quizzes

> I just completed the post lab quiz for lab 1 but it doesn't let me see which questions I answered incorrectly. Is there any way you can turn this setting on?


> I was just wondering how I can check what 2 answers I got wrong?

These quizzes are set for unlimited attempts because 70% or higher is needed to continue the next steps. Therefore, the feedback functionality is limited on them. You would not see which questions were answered incorrectly in a previous attempt.  

### Access to the datasets

> I have completed to pre-lab, post-lab, and lab videos for Lab 1. Can I have access to the data now?

After the completion of postlab quiz with 70% or higher grade, you are allowed to download the data sets assigned to you. You may need to refresh your browser to enable the hyperlink for [Experiment 1 Raoult's Law Data](https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757299/View).

### The data for the worksheet

> What data do I use?

The worksheet should be completed by using the [Experiment 1 Raoult's Law Data](https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757299/View) dataset. This data set belongs to the `hexane` and `heptane` mixture.

### The data for the Excel file

> What data do I use?

Due to the [rubric](https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757287/View) and unlike the worksheet, your Excel file should include the analyses of both data sets: 

- `DCM` and `acetone`
- `pentane` and `hexane`

You will need to choose and report one of the data sets in the worksheet. Please make sure that you indicate which data set you chose by marking the appropriate checkbox in the worksheet.

[Experiment 1 Raoult's Law Students](https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757294/View) dataset is for only practice. This data set is used for instructional video. Students should download the `DCM` and `acetone` data and do the analysis while watching the video for the Excel workshop: [Experiment 1 Raoult's Law Excel Workshop](https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757297/View).

###  The worksheet

> Is the assignment only a worksheet, no lab report?

Yes. This experiment has only worksheet. You do not write a lab report.

### Using the online version of MS Office and a Chromebook

> I was wondering if you could assist me with making the graphs for Experiment 1... This is a very short video the issue I am running into.

Watching the video, I see that you are using the online version of MS Office and a Chromebook. I have not tested Chromebook specifically but I am quite positive that you need a regular computer to complete this course assignments. Even an old laptop/desktop maybe more powerful than a Chromebook. You should download and install a copy of MS Office on your computer in order to fully follow my instructions to make graphs and calculations in Excel. Here is the [link](https://offices.depaul.edu/information-services/services/Software/Pages/Software-for-Personal-Computers.aspx) for students to obtain a free MS Office copy.

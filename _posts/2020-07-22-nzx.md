## The area values for the pure substances

These values can be extracted from the Liquid data (the first table) and Gas data (the second table) separately. So, we will read this information as follows:

* When Part A equals to 1.0, it is __pure pentane__. Pure pentane has both liquid and gas phases.
  * Liquid area: $ 5.10 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $
  * Gas area: $ 6.19 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $
* When Part A equals to 0.0, it is __pure hexane__. Pure hexane has both liquid and gas phases.
  * Liquid area: $ 6.57 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $
  * Gas area: $ 2.82 \times 10^4 ~pA.s $

## Pre/postlab quizzes

These quizzes are set for unlimited attempts because 70% or higher is needed to continue the next steps. Therefore, the feedback functionality is limited on them. You would not see which questions were answered incorrectly in a previous attempt.  

## Access to the datasets

After the completion of postlab quiz with 70% or higher grade, you are allowed to download the data sets assigned to you. You may need to refresh your browser to enable the hyperlink for [Experiment 1 Raoult's Law Data](https://d2l.depaul.edu/d2l/le/content/761098/viewContent/6757299/View).

## Blog

Each blog post is a Markdown file in [`blog/_posts/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/blog/_posts).  File names have post date and a short title.  The short title is used for permanent URL links, so must be unique to each blog post.  For example: [`2012-02-20-github-of-science.md`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/blog/_posts/2012-02-20-github-of-science.md).  Posts have the following YAML top matter:

```
---
layout: post
title: Some thoughts on a GitHub of Science
author: Trevor Bedford
image: /images/blog/github_large.png
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title` and `author` are required, while `image` is optional.  The author name should correspond to the team member `title` tag for proper linking of posts to authors.  All blog images should live in [`images/blog/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/images/blog) and be referred as relative to the base directory, begining with `/images/`.

## Papers

Each paper lives in [`papers/_posts/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/papers/_posts).  File names, used to construct permalinks, are first author plus short (1-2 word) title, for example [`2012-04-30-bedford-canalization.md`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/papers/_posts/2012-04-30-bedford-canalization.md).   Papers have the following YAML metadata:

```
---
layout: paper
title: Canalization of the evolutionary trajectory of the human influenza virus
image: /images/papers/bedford-canalization.png
authors: Bedford T, Rambaut A, Pascual M.
year: 2012
ref: Bedford et al. 2012.
journal: "BMC Biol 10: 38."
pdf: /pdfs/papers/bedford-canalization.pdf
supplement: /pdfs/papers/bedford-canalization-supp.pdf
github: http://github.com/trvrb/canalization
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title`, `image`, `authors`, `year`, `ref`, `journal` are required.  Tags `pdf`, `supplement`, `github` are optional.  The image should be a 120x120 pixel tile.  All paper images and PDFs should reside in [`images/papers/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/images/papers) and [`pdfs/papers/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/pdfs/papers) respectively.

## Team

Each team member has a Markdown file in [`team/_posts/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/team/_posts).  File names are join date followed by first and last name, like [`2013-09-30-trevor-bedford.md`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/blob/master/team/_posts/2013-09-30-trevor-bedford.md).  YAML follows:

```
---
layout: member
title: Trevor Bedford
position: Principal investigator
handle: trvrb
email: trvrb@trevorbedford.com
twitter: trvrb
github: trvrb
image: /images/team/trevor-bedford.jpg
cv: /pdfs/team/bedford-cv.pdf
---
```

Tags `layout`, `title`, `last name`, `position`, `handle`, `image` are required, while `twitter`, `github`, `cv` are optional.  The image should be a 260x260 pixel tile.  All member images and PDFs should be placed in [`images/team/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/images/team) and [`pdfs/team/`](https://github.com/blab/blotter/tree/master/pdfs/team) respectively.

## Biking Activities

### 1. Define New Year

* Make new year definition file in `/_biking-annual`.
* Add the new year to '.years' field in `/biking.md` file. All auto-generated tables and plots read the years from this field, so otherwise the dynamic plot and 'All Logs' table in 'Overview' page will not be updated.
* Add the new year internal url to `/_data/navigation.yml` > 'biking' submenu.

### 2. Define New Month

* First update `/_data/biking/_index.yml` in YYYY-MM format.
* Make new month definition file in `YML` format in `/_data/biking/` folder.
* Make new month definition file in `/_biking-activities`.

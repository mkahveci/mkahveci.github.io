## Introduction & Background

* **Pedagogical Discontentment** is the cognitive conflict a teacher experiences when there is a mismatch between their pedagogical goals and their actual classroom practices.
* It is considered a key indicator of a teacher's **receptivity to educational reform**.
* This construct is distinct from general job satisfaction as it is specifically focused on the act of teaching.
* Measuring pedagogical discontentment is challenging because it is deeply influenced by **cultural contexts, national standards, and local educational reforms**.

---

## The Original STPD Scale

* The Science Teachers' Pedagogical Discontentment (STPD) scale was originally developed and validated in the United States by Southerland and her colleagues in 2012.
* The original instrument identified **six distinct factors** of discontentment based on extensive interviews with U.S. teachers.
* The original 21-item scale demonstrated high overall reliability (Cronbach's $\alpha = 0.93$).

### Original Six-Factor Structure

> **Placeholder for Table 1: Reliability Coefficients of the Subscales**
> *This table should show the six original subscales (Inquiry Instruction, Ability to Teach All Students, Science Content Knowledge, etc.) and their respective Cronbach's Alpha values.*

## Problem Statement & Research Questions

The STPD scale was developed based on the experiences of U.S. teachers and is rooted in U.S. educational standards. Its measurement integrity has not been established in other international contexts.

This study aimed to validate the STPD scale for use in Saudi Arabia.

--

### Research Questions

1.  What is the underlying factor structure of the Arabic version of the STPD scale, and does this structure correspond to the original six-factor model observed in the U.S. context?
2.  Are the scores from the Arabic STPD scale reliable enough to be used for future research in this new context?

---

## Methodology: Cross-Cultural Validation

A rigorous, multi-step process was used to translate and adapt the instrument for the Saudi Arabian context, following the framework proposed by Sperber and colleagues in 1994.

1.  **Translation & Back-Translation:** The scale was translated into Arabic, and then independently translated back into English by a separate bilingual expert.
2.  **Expert Review:** Four native English-speaking experts compared the original and back-translated versions for comparability of language and meaning. Items with low scores were re-translated.
3.  **Contextual Adaptation:** Items were revised to reflect the Saudi educational system. For example, "state and national standards" was changed to "requirements... set out by the Ministry of Education".
4.  **Item Omission:** One item related to national testing requirements was removed as no such benchmarks existed in Saudi Arabia at the time, resulting in a 20-item scale for this study.

---

## Methodology: Participants

* The final 20-item Arabic STPD scale was administered to a large sample of science teachers in Saudi Arabia.
* **Total Participants: 994**
  * 656 Females & 338 Males
* **Subjects Taught:**
  * General Science (Elementary/Middle): 68.6%
  * Chemistry: 9.4%
  * Physics: 9.1%
  * Biology: 5.6%
* **Teaching Experience:** The sample represented a wide range, from first-year teachers (36.6% in their first 5 years) to veterans (9.3% with 25+ years).

---

## Results: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)

* The dataset (N=994) was randomly split in half. EFA was conducted on the first half (N=471).
* The data was highly suitable for factor analysis (KMO = 0.974; Bartlett's Test significant at p < .001).
* The analysis revealed a striking result: **only one factor** emerged from the data that met the inclusion criteria.
* This single factor explained **71% of the total variance** in scores, which is considered a very strong result in the social sciences.

> **Placeholder for Table 5: Total Variance Explained**
> *This table should show the initial eigenvalues, demonstrating that only one component has an eigenvalue greater than 1.0, explaining 70.671% of the variance.*

---

## Results: Factor Structure & Reliability

* All 20 items loaded strongly onto the single, unified factor.
* The lowest factor loading was 0.575, indicating all items were strong contributors to this single construct.
* This one-dimensional structure is a significant departure from the original six-factor structure found in the U.S. context.
* The reliability of the 20-item Arabic STPD scale was exceptionally high.
* **Cronbach's Alpha = 0.978**

---

## Results: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)

* CFA was performed on the second half of the data (N=511) to confirm the one-factor model discovered in the EFA.
* The analysis confirmed that the one-factor model is a "good fit" for the data.

> *This figure should visually represent the confirmed one-factor model, with all 20 items loading onto the single latent STPD construct.*

---

## Discussion

* The results demonstrate that the Arabic version of the STPD scale is a valid and highly reliable instrument.
* However, in the Saudi Arabian context, pedagogical discontentment is perceived as a **single, one-dimensional construct**, not as six distinct facets.
* Saudi teachers in this sample did not differentiate between discontentment related to inquiry, assessment, content knowledge, or other specific pedagogical areas. Instead, they experienced it as a unified phenomenon.

--

### Why a Single Factor?

* One potential explanation is the difference in professional development landscapes.
* Teachers in Saudi Arabia may have had less exposure to targeted, long-term professional development on specific reform-based practices (like inquiry-based instruction) compared to their U.S. counterparts.
* As a result, their discontent may be more generalized rather than tied to specific, nuanced aspects of teaching practice that the original six factors were designed to capture.

---

## Conclusion

* The Arabic version of the STPD scale is a psychometrically sound instrument for use in Saudi Arabia and similar contexts.
* It reliably measures a **one-dimensional construct** of "Science Teachers' Pedagogical Discontentment".
* This study provides a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers to assess teachers' overall receptivity to reform in the region.
* It also highlights the critical importance of cross-cultural validation, as instruments do not always maintain their original factor structure across different cultural and educational systems.

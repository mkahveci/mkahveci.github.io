	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Research suggests that teachers’ affective states are closely linked to success in professional development movements (Schmidt & Datnow, 2005; Van Driel, Beijaard, & Verloop, 2011).</li>
		<li>Developed as part of a project about Saudi Arabian teachers’ affective states towards reforms in science education.</li>
		<li> Three aspects were investigated in the project. Science teachers’
			<ul>
				<li>pedagogical discontentment (STPD),</li>
				<li>self-efficacy (STEBI), and</li>
				<li>intentions to reform (IRSTS).</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>Conceptualisation of Pedagogical Discontentment</h3>

	<ul>
		<li> Pedagogical discontentment means
			<ul>
				<li>teachers’ assessment of contextual aspects, and</li>
				<li>a state of cognitive conflict.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>High levels of pedagogical discontentment might be interpreted as an important precursor to change.</li>

<section id="purpose" class="slide level1"

	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Purpose</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>To explore the measurement integrity of the scores on the Science
		Teachers’ Pedagogical Discontentment (STPD) scale in the Saudi Arabia
		context</p>
</section>
<section id="research-questions" class="slide level1"
		 style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Research Questions</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>What structure underlies responses to the measure</p>
	<p>—that is, does the (Arabic) structure correspond to the original
		scale? <em><strong>(Reflecting the validity issue)</strong></em></p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Are scores on the STPD scale as a whole and as per each factor
		category reliable? <em><strong>(Reflecting the reliability
			issue)</strong></em></p>
</section>
<section id="method" class="slide level1"
		 style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Method</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>This is a survey research designed to investigate science teachers’
		pedagogical discontentment in Saudi Arabia (Jaeger, 1988)</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Conducting a factor analysis of the observed scores on a given
		instrument, one can determine if the test is measuring the variables it
		purports to, which is the definition of construct validation (Stapleton,
		1997)</p>
</section>
<section id="cross-cultural-validation" class="slide level1"
		 style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Cross-Cultural Validation</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Attending to Sperber et al.’s (1994) cautions and suggestions, the
		original instrument was first translated into Arabic by a bilingual
		science educator fluent in both English and Arabic languages.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>The Arabic version of the instrument was back- translated to English
		by independent science educators in Saudi Arabia also fluent in
		English.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>The Saudi science educators did not see the original English
		instrument.</p>

<section id="item-revision-for-a-better-match-to-the-arabic-context"
		 class="slide level1" style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Item Revision for a Better Match
		to the Arabic Context</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Some of the items were revised and clarified to respond to the Saudi
		Arabia context. For example;</p>
	<ul>
		<li>“balancing personal science teaching goals with those of state and
			national standards”</li>
		<li>“balancing personal science teaching goals with those requirements,
			standards, goals set out by the Ministry of Education”</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section id="one-item-omitted" class="slide level1"
		 style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">One Item Omitted</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>“balancing personal science teaching goals with state/national
		testing requirements” was omitted from the STPD scale because the
		Ministry of Education has not released any testing benchmarks or
		standards.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-final-stage-of-development" class="slide level1"
		 style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">The Final Stage of
		Development</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>The STPD instrument that eventually included <strong>20
		items</strong> was evaluated by <strong>seven</strong> Saudi science
		teachers specialising in physics, chemistry, biology, and geology, in
		terms of suitability for the local population of teachers.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Their feedback was sought to identify any ambiguities or
		difficulties.</p>
</section>
<section id="sample-demographics" class="slide level1"
		 style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Sample &amp; Demographics</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>A total of 994 science teachers
			<ul>
				<li>656 females and 338 males</li>
				<li>teaching physics (N=90, 9.1%), chemistry (N=93, 9.4%), biology
					(N=56, 5.6%) at secondary school level</li>
				<li>general science (N=682, 68.6%) at elementary and middle school
					levels</li>
				<li><p>teaching experience: 36.6% participants fall into their first 5
					years, 26.2% up to 10 years, 15.5% up to 15</p>

						up to 20 years, and 9.3% 25 or more years</h2></li>

	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Data Check &amp; Cleaning</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>All of the items were evaluated in terms of their goodness of fit for
		the normality condition.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>The main indicator in this stage was the identification of cases,
		those standard scores of which exceed +/-3 boundary condition.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Scores were calculated in SPSS’s list-wise selection, resulting in
		982 valid cases. Thus, 12 cases were omitted from further analyses at
		this stage allowing one to employ advanced parametric test.</p>

	<p>•</p>
	<p>This analysis suggest that Arabic STPD instrument has a different

		that EFA and CFA would be re-run over the dataset.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The EFA was run over IBM SPSS 19</li>
		<li>The KMO index yielding .974 &gt; .05 suggests that the correlation
			matrix is not an identity matrix and sampling is suitable to run the
			factor analysis</li>
		<li>the Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity (p=.000&lt;.050) confirms that
			there is a high correlation among the items, and thus, factor analysis

	<p>•</p>
	<p>As chi-square per degree of freedom is in the acceptable region

		threshold values, one would conclude that the suggested one-factor model
		is a good fit.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Thus, Arabic STPD instrument is a one-dimensional instrument
		measuring one construct, named STPD.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>With respect to treatments to suggested modification indices, many of
		the highly loaded ones are applied because there is only one latent
		variable and observed variables predicting common latent variables could
		share error variances.</p>

	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Discussion</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Having only one component, namely “Science teachers’ pedagogical
		discontentment (STPD)” indicates that the teachers in Saudi Arabia
		perceive their pedagogical discontentment as one-dimensional mismatch
		with their pedagogical goals and teaching practice.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>The potential reason for one-dimensional result could be that Arabic
		science teachers might have less experience in professional development
		towards alternative teaching methods such as inquiry-based science
		education as opposed to their American counterparts.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>This reason might reveal broader understandings about reforms and
		their effects in Saudi Arabia context.</p>
</section>
<section id="discussion-1" class="slide level1"
		 style="page-break-before:always; ">
	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Discussion</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>This evidence is alignment with the current debate in Saudi Arabia,
		indeed.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>Although there has been a shift from traditional teaching to
		inquiry-based science education, Almazroa and Alorini, as cited by
		Almazroa (2013) claim that <strong>professional development activities
			that are offered to teachers do not meet the demand of new
			curriculum</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="slide level1"

	<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Conclusion</h1>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>The results of this study confirm that the Arabic version of the STPD
		scale is valid and highly reliable.</p>
	<p>•</p>
	<p>It can be used in this specific context as <strong>a one- dimensional
		affective state</strong> to measure teachers’ pedagogical discontentment
		towards teaching science.</p>

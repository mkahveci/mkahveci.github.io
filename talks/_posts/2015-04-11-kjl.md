### Q & A Session

1. How were the science teachers sampled for this study, and was there any consideration for different teaching experience levels?
  - *The study included 994 science teachers with various teaching experiences, including general science and specialized teachers.*
2. What statistical methods were used to validate and analyze the STPD scale?
  - *Both Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) were used to evaluate the validity of the scale.*
3. What was the main conclusion regarding the dimensionality of the Arabic version of the STPD scale?
  - *The Arabic STPD scale was found to be one-dimensional, suggesting that Saudi Arabian teachers perceive pedagogical discontentment differently than their American counterparts.*

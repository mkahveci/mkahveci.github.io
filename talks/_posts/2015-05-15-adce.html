## The Problem: An Imbalance in Education

* For decades, educational objectives have been categorized into three domains: **cognitive, affective, and psychomotor** (Bloom et al. 1956, 1964).
* The **cognitive domain** has received significantly more attention from researchers, particularly in chemistry education.
* This has led to a global issue where, despite an increase in university enrollment, the proportion of students choosing science fields is **decreasing**.
* International studies like PISA and the EU's "Rocard Report" highlight this alarming trend.

    A focus on affective dimensions is crucial to address this global lack of interest and retention in science.

## What Are Affective Dimensions?

The affective domain refers to the complex constellation of psychological constructs that influence learning.

This includes a student's:
* Attitudes
* Values
* Beliefs
* Opinions
* Emotions
* Interests
* Motivation
* Degree of acceptance or rejection

### Why Is Affect So Often Ignored?

1.  **Measurement is Challenging:** Affective constructs are not easily observed, and students may mask their true feelings to get credit for "valued behaviors".
2.  **Perception of Science:** Many scientists and educators present science as purely objective and reason-driven, separate from subjective feelings and values.
3.  **Assessment Focus:** Educational systems worldwide prioritize assessing cognitive outcomes because it is perceived to be easier than measuring affective ones.

## Goal of This Volume

This book was created to gather the most up-to-date expertise and research about the influence of the **affective domain on learning in chemistry** into a single, accessible resource.

We hope this volume will:
* Serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners.
* Inspire greater consideration of the affective domain in both chemistry teaching and future education research.

--

### Structure of the Book

The book is organized into two distinct parts that bridge the gap between foundational ideas and practical application.

* **Part I: Theoretical Considerations**
    * Reviews the core theories related to the influence of the affective domain on chemistry learning.

* **Part II: Research and Practice**
    * Connects research findings to the practical challenges of teaching and learning chemistry.

---

## Part I: Theoretical Considerations

This section establishes the conceptual groundwork for understanding affect in chemistry education.

**Key themes include:**
* Constructivist ideas and their influence on affective objectives (Taber).
* Methods for evaluating affective dimensions (Rahayu).
* Theories of motivation and interest, and the role of context-based learning (Menthe & Parchmann).
* The impact of gender on student affect in chemistry (A. Kahveci).
* The role of intuitive beliefs in teaching socio-scientific issues (Dittmer & Gebhard).

---

## Part II: Research and Practice

This section presents a global collection of studies and practical applications.

**Key themes include:**
* Fostering engagement for special-needs students through inquiry (Abels).
* Meeting the affective and cognitive needs of gifted learners (Taber).
* Evaluating affect in context-based learning environments (Fechner et al.).
* Cross-cultural validation of affective instruments (Xu et al.).
* Chemistry self-efficacy in secondary schools (Cheung).
* Problem-based learning labs and their influence on student attitudes (Yoon et al.).
* The potential of cognitive neuroscience methods in affective research (Liu & Huang).
* Using drawings to explore teachers' pedagogical attitudes (Markic & Eilks).
* Teacher attitudes towards linguistic heterogeneity (Markic).
* Gender-based affective states toward learning physical chemistry (M. Kahveci).

---

## Conclusion

* The historic focus on the cognitive domain has coincided with declining student interest and retention in the sciences.
* Positive affective dimensions—like interest, motivation, and positive attitudes—are strongly correlated with student persistence and performance.
* This volume provides a comprehensive foundation of theory, research, and practice to empower educators and researchers to better address the **affective dimensions in chemistry education**.

# AI-Powered Differentiation

## A Practical Guide for Supporting ELLs

## The Challenge: Reaching Every Learner

* **Differentiation is complex.** Creating materials for multiple proficiency levels for every lesson is incredibly time-consuming.

* **Language is a barrier.** Scaffolding complex texts, scientific jargon, and abstract concepts for our ELLs is a daily struggle.

---

### How can we provide targeted support for our English Learners without spending our entire prep period on one activity?

---

## Our Goal Today

To learn how to use the **ELL Content Modification Templates** to instantly create scaffolded materials for our students.

These prompts are built on the **REACH proficiency scale**, providing a consistent framework for differentiation.

---

## Let's See It in Action: Chemistry

We need to adapt a dense paragraph on stoichiometry for a 'Reaching' (Level 3) student.

```prompt
Act as an ESL Specialist and Chemistry Teacher

Task: Modify the following content for an ELL student at the
REACH proficiency level of Reaching (Level 3).

Content to Modify: "Stoichiometry is the quantitative study of
the relationships between the amounts of reactants used and the
amounts of products formed by a chemical reaction..."
```

**Result:** The AI provides simplified text, a key vocabulary
box, and a helpful analogy (e.g., "Think of it like a recipe
for a cake...").

---

## Adapting for All REACH Levels

By changing just one line in the prompt, we can generate support for any student:

* **Entering (Level 1):** The AI might provide key terms with images and simple translations.

* **Emerging (Level 2):** It can generate bilingual vocabulary lists and simple, declarative sentences.

* **Reaching (Level 3):** It simplifies the text and adds analogies, as we saw.

* **Bridging (Level 4):** It can add sentence starters for a summary paragraph or ask higher-order thinking questions.

---

## Templates for Every Subject

This approach isn't just for science. We have templates for:

* **Physics:** Modifies problem sets & diagrams.

* **Biology:** Simplifies complex terminology.

* **ELA:** Scaffolds reading passages & prompts.

* **Mathematics:** Differentiates word problems.

* **Forensic Science:** Clarifies technical jargon.

* **Theater Arts:** Adapts archaic language (e.g., Shakespeare).

---

## Best Practices & Ethics

* **You are the expert.** Always review, edit, and adapt what the AI gives you. You know your students best.

* **Verify, verify, verify.** AI can make mistakes. Fact-check any content before sharing it with students.

* **Protect student privacy.** Never input any personally identifiable student information into an AI tool.

* **It's a starting point, not the final product.** Use AI to handle the "first draft" so you can focus on refining and teaching.

## Your Turn: Let's Differentiate!

1. Take out a short piece of text (2-3 sentences) from a lesson you are teaching next week.

2. Visit the project page and choose the template for your subject.

3. Copy the prompt, paste your text into an AI tool, and see how it scaffolds the content for an ELL student!

## 1. The Challenge: Reaching Every Learner

<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
    <p><strong>Differentiation is complex.</strong> Creating materials for multiple proficiency levels for every lesson is incredibly time-consuming.</p>
</div>

<div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
    <p><strong>Language is a barrier.</strong> Scaffolding complex texts, scientific jargon, and abstract concepts for our ELLs is a daily struggle.</p>
</div>

---

## How can we provide targeted support for our English Learners without spending our entire prep period on one activity?

---

## 2. Our Goal Today

To learn how to use the **ELL Content Modification Templates** to instantly create scaffolded materials for our students.

These prompts are built on the **REACH proficiency scale**, providing a consistent framework for differentiation.

---

## 3. Let's See It in Action: Chemistry

We need to adapt a dense paragraph on stoichiometry for a 'Reaching' (Level 3) student.

```prompt
Act as an ESL Specialist and Chemistry Teacher

Task: Modify the following content for an ELL student at the
REACH proficiency level of Reaching (Level 3).

Content to Modify: "Stoichiometry is the quantitative study of
the relationships between the amounts of reactants used and the
amounts of products formed by a chemical reaction..."
```

---

## 4. Let's See It in Action: Chemistry

<div class="split-layout">
    <div class="left-side">
        <h3>Original Content</h3>
        <p>"Stoichiometry is the quantitative study of the relationships between the amounts of reactants used and the amounts of products formed by a chemical reaction..."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right-side fragment">
        <h3>AI-Modified Version</h3>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The AI provides simplified text, a key vocabulary box, and a helpful analogy (e.g., "Think of it like a recipe for a cake...").</p>
    </div>
</div>

---

## 5. Adapting for All REACH Levels

By changing just one line in the prompt, we can generate support for any student:

* **Entering (Level 1):** The AI might provide key terms with images and simple translations.

* **Emerging (Level 2):** It can generate bilingual vocabulary lists and simple, declarative sentences.

* **Reaching (Level 3):** It simplifies the text and adds analogies, as we saw.

* **Bridging (Level 4):** It can add sentence starters for a summary paragraph or ask higher-order thinking questions.

---

## 6. Templates for Every Subject

This approach isn't just for science. We have templates for:

* **Physics:** Modifies problem sets & diagrams.

* **Biology:** Simplifies complex terminology.

* **ELA:** Scaffolds reading passages & prompts.

* **Mathematics:** Differentiates word problems.

* **Forensic Science:** Clarifies technical jargon.

* **Theater Arts:** Adapts archaic language (e.g., Shakespeare).

---

## 7. Best Practices & Ethics

* **You are the expert.** Always review, edit, and adapt what the AI gives you. You know your students best.

* **Verify, verify, verify.** AI can make mistakes. Fact-check any content before sharing it with students.

* **Protect student privacy.** Never input any personally identifiable student information into an AI tool.

* **It's a starting point, not the final product.** Use AI to handle the "first draft" so you can focus on refining and teaching.

## 8. Your Turn: Let's Differentiate!

1. Take out a short piece of text (2-3 sentences) from a lesson you are teaching next week.
2. Visit the project page and choose the template for your subject. <a href="https://kahveci.pw/ai-in-education/" target="_blank">https://kahveci.pw/ai-in-education</a>
3. Copy the prompt, paste your text into an AI tool, and see how it scaffolds the content for an ELL student!

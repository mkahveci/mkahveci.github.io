## 1 Goals

- It is important that you identify the cathode and anode half-reactions for each galvanic cell before beginning the following calculations.

### 1.1 Experimental _E_ for Cu

- From the standard reduction potential, _E<sup>◦</sup>_, of the copper half-reaction of 0.340 V and the concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup>, calculate the actual value of _E_ for the experimental copper half-reaction using the Nernst equation (Equation 1).

### 1.2 Experimental _E_ for Al

From the actual value of _E_ for the experimental copper half-reaction and the measured value of Εcell for the copper-aluminum cell, determine the value of E for the experimental half-reaction for aluminum (Equation 2).

### 1.3 Experimental _E<sup>◦</sup>_ for Al

From the calculated value of _E_ for the experimental aluminum half-reaction and the actual
concentration of Al<sup>3+</sup>, calculate _E<sup>◦</sup>_ for the aluminum half-reaction using the Nernst equation (Equation 1).

### 1.4 Experimental _E_ for Zn

From the actual value of _E_ for the experimental copper half-reaction and the measured value of Εcell for the copper-zinc cell, determine the value of _E_ for the experimental half-reaction for zinc (Equation 2).

### 1.5 Experimental _E<sup>◦</sup>_ for Zn

From the calculated value of _E_ for the experimental zinc half-reaction and the actual concentration
of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, calculate _E<sup>◦</sup>_ for the zinc half-reaction using the Nernst equation (Equation 1).

### 1.6 Experimental _E_ for Pb

From the actual value of _E_ for the experimental copper half-reaction and the measured value of Εcell for the copper-lead cell, determine the value of _E_ for the experimental half-reaction for lead (Equation 2).

### 1.7 Experimental _E<sup>◦</sup>_ for Pb

From the calculated value of E for the experimental lead half-reaction and the actual concentration
of $$Pb^{2+}$$, calculate _E<sup>◦</sup>_ for the lead half-reaction using the Nernst equation (Equation 1).

### 1.8 Internal Consistency Check

Using the experimental _E_ values for zinc and lead calculated above, calculate $$E_\text{cell}$$. Compare this result to the value you measured.

## 2 Assignment

- Watch the videos, pass the postlab quiz, and download your data set.
- Analyze the data in Excel.
- Submit your worksheet in a PDF file.
- You should review the `Lab Report Guidelines`, `Sample General Chemistry Lab Report`, and `Appendix E` on D2L while writing to ensure that your drafts are correctly formatted.

## 3 Q&A Highlights

### 3.1 Printing off the worksheets

{% include callout.html content="I was wondering if I may print off the worksheets for Experiments 11 and 12, hand write them and then upload them as a pdf file as I did for a previous experiment. In the lab guide, it says you may either write or type your responses, but other places it says that they must be typed. Thank you for the clarification!" type="danger" %}

Yes, you may print and fill out them. However, if any part of the worksheet requires you to copy and paste a graph, you should print and attach the graphs physically. One drawback for this approach is that you may not have enough space to attach a graph. In that case, you could add your graph as a separate page and make sure that you refer to the page in the given space, where you are expected tp provide the graph.

## 4 Assessment 

### 4.1 Feedback

- The PDF file you uploaded: annotations are highlighted with gray background and pink font.
- E-Rubric: D2L will show the rubric with scores and any feedback provided.

## 1 Goals

### 1.1 Identification of the unknown amino acid

- Plot a graph of pH vs. V(mL) of NaOH added. 
- If a break (or breaks, in the case of polyprotic acids) is clearly visible, estimate the pKa (or multiple pKa values in the case of polyprotic acids).
- Use the example titration curve in the previous slide as a guidance:
  - The vertical dashed line shows equivalence point and corresponding NaOH volume.
  - The horizontal dashed line shows pH value, which is equal to pKa value. So, you determined the pKa value. 
  - Repeat this process for each break if you have multiple breaks and determine all $$pKa$$ values.  
- Estimate the molar mass of the acid. 
- Use these data to find a match in Table 2, Table 3, or Table 4.

### 1.2 Calculate the molar mass of the acid

- At the equivalence point:

{% include eq.html file="yfh-1.svg" %}

which means:

{% include eq.html file="yfh-2.svg" %}

- Calculate molar mass using the moles of amino acid and the mass of sample.

{% include eq.html file="yfh-3.svg" %}

### 1.3 Determine the identity of amino acid

- Using the pKa and molar mass values determine the identity of amino acid.
- Find a match in Table 2, Table 3, or Table 4.

## 2 Assignment

- Watch the videos, pass the postlab quiz, and download your data set.
- Analyze the data in Excel
- Submit your partial lab report in PDF and all calculations in Excel file.
- You should review the `Lab Report Guidelines`, `Sample General Chemistry Lab Report`, and `Appendix E` on D2L while writing to ensure that your drafts are correctly formatted.

## 3 Q&A Highlights

### 3.1 The unknown amino acid I found doesn't match 

{% include callout.html content="The molar mass of the unknown amino acid I found doesn't match any of the options in Tables 2-4. My unknown number is `XYZ` [hidden for general post]. I'm unable to figure out which calculation I am not doing correctly and have attached my Excel file. Based on my graph, I think I have a monoprotic acid and that I did do the calculation correctly since the break is approximately `XYZ` [hidden for general post] and my calculated molar mass is `XYZ` [hidden for general post]." type="danger" %}

Reviewing your calculations in Excel reveals that you are pretty much okay with the methodology. I would double-check the values such as the mass of sample, etc. If they are okay, then you can leave this analysis as is. Hint: Your calculated molar mass is much smaller than its actual value. So, I would not rely on molar mass if everything is correct, and it stays as is. Finding the correct half-way(s) might be much more helpful.

With respect to finding the half-way points, I would make the plot much larger. Only then, you would see that there are more than one half-way points.

{% include eq.html file="gc-2.svg" %}

- Determine the partial pressure of each component (Equation 3).

{% include eq.html file="gc-3.svg" %}
 
- Generate the Raoult's law plot (see Figure 1 in the manual).

## 2 Assignment

- Watch the Excel workshop video for calculations and plotting expectations.
- Download the students spreadsheet for the workshop and do step by step calculations in the workshop.
- Download the data set and do the same analysis.
- Upload the Worksheet in PDF format (download the template as MS Word file and fill it out by following the instructions).
- Upload all calculations and data tables in an MS Excel file.

## 3 Q&A Highlights

### 3.1 The area values for the pure substances

{% include callout.html content="I noticed that we did not have the area (pA.s) values for the pure substances. This value is necessary in order to begin calculations on the rest of the data. I have watched the lab introduction videos as well as your excel tutorial but I could not find this information and am hoping for some guidance to point me in the right direction." type="danger" %}

These values can be extracted from the Liquid data (the first table) and Gas data (the second table) separately. So, we will read this information as follows:

* When Part A equals to 1.0, it is `pure pentane`. Pure pentane has both liquid and gas phases.
  * Liquid area: {% include eq.html file="gc-4.svg" inline=true %}

  * Gas area: {% include eq.html file="gc-5.svg"  inline=true %}

* When Part A equals to 0.0, it is `pure hexane`. Pure hexane has both liquid and gas phases.
  * Liquid area: {% include eq.html file="gc-6.svg"  inline=true %}

  * Gas area: {% include eq.html file="gc-7.svg"  inline=true %}

### 3.2 Pre/postlab quizzes

{% include callout.html content="I just completed the post lab quiz for lab 1 but it doesn't let me see which questions I answered incorrectly. Is there any way you can turn this setting on?" type="danger" %}


{% include callout.html content="I was just wondering how I can check what 2 answers I got wrong?" type="danger" %}

These quizzes are set for unlimited attempts because 70% or higher is needed to continue the next steps. Therefore, the feedback functionality is limited on them. You would not see which questions were answered incorrectly in a previous attempt.  

### 3.3 Access to the datasets

{% include callout.html content="I have completed to pre-lab, post-lab, and lab videos for Lab 1. Can I have access to the data now?" type="danger" %}

After the completion of postlab quiz with 70% or higher grade, you are allowed to download the data sets assigned to you. You may need to refresh your browser to enable the hyperlink for `Experiment 1 Raoult's Law Data`.

### 3.4 The data for the worksheet

{% include callout.html content="What data do I use?" type="danger" %}

The worksheet should be completed by using the Experiment 1 Raoult's Law Data dataset. This data set belongs to the `hexane` and `heptane` mixture.

### 3.5 The data for the Excel file

{% include callout.html content="What data do I use?" type="danger" %}

According to the rubric, your Excel file should include the analyses of both data sets: 

- `DCM` and `acetone`
- `pentane` and `hexane`

You will need to choose and report one of the data sets in the worksheet. Please make sure that you indicate which data set you chose by marking the appropriate checkbox in the worksheet.

`Raoult's Law Students dataset` is for only practice. This data set is used for instructional video. Students should download the `DCM` and `acetone` data and do the analysis while watching the video for the Excel workshop: `Raoult's Law Excel Workshop`.

### 3.6  The worksheet

{% include callout.html content="Is the assignment only a worksheet, no lab report?" type="danger" %}

Yes. This experiment has only worksheet. You do not write a lab report.

### 3.7 Using the online version of MS Office and a Chromebook

{% include callout.html content="I was wondering if you could assist me with making the graphs for Experiment 1... This is a very short video the issue I am running into." type="danger" %}

Watching the video, I see that you are using the online version of MS Office and a Chromebook. I have not tested Chromebook specifically but I am quite positive that you need a regular computer to complete this course assignments. Even an old laptop/desktop maybe more powerful than a Chromebook. You should download and install a copy of MS Office on your computer in order to fully follow my instructions to make graphs and calculations in Excel. Here is the [link](https://offices.depaul.edu/information-services/services/Software/Pages/Software-for-Personal-Computers.aspx) for students to obtain a free MS Office copy.

## 4 Assessment

### 4.1 Misconceptions

{% include callout.html content="Pentane and hexane can be considered dipole-dipole due to the both being dipolar molecules." type="danger" %}

Please do your research more carefully. How do you determine the polarity of a compound?

{% include callout.html content="Raoult's Law Plot is made with trendlines (linear fit function)." type="danger" %}

Not correct. This plot has hypothetical diagonal lines in order to observe deviations from the ideal behavior.

### 4.2 Formatting issues

- Figures have gridlines. 
  - We require no gridlines on the figures. Please review the `Lab Report Guidelines` and `Sample General Chemistry Lab Report`.
- Figure titles are missing.
- Ranges for the chart axis values are not properly constrained.
  - e.g. Raoult's Law Plot should be constrained as follows:
    - Pressure (torr) ranges from 0.0 to 514.0
    - Mole fraction ranges from 0.0 to 1.0
  - This way your data will be easily interpreted by looking at the graph. 
  - Remember we use plots to summarize our data in visual manner, not to confuse us even more.
 
### 4.3 Issues with calculations

- Formulae are missing.
- Values are not properly plugged in with units.
- Calculations are not shown step by step until the final result.
  - i.e. Writing a formula and a value as its final result do not suffice the requirement: `Include all of the steps necessary to obtain the correct value`.

### 4.4 Feedback

- The PDF file you uploaded: annotations are highlighted with gray background and pink font.
- E-Rubric: D2L will show the rubric with scores and any feedback provided.

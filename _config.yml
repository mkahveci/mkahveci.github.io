description: The Kahveci Group at Loyola University Chicago works at the interface of affective dimensions in chemistry education research. We apply quantitative research methods to analyze data and understand how learning complex chemistry topics is influenced by affective variables in relation to personal characteristics. Additionally, we are interested in studying dominant modalities of remote learning as an extension of the post pandemic influences on the practice of chemistry education.

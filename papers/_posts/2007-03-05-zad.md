This review investigates the use of certain types of interaction in mathematics education. These types
include interaction between students, interaction between teacher and students, and interaction between
students and leaning technology. In small cooperative groups, factors that affect interaction are as
follows: group composition, type of interaction, effect of teacher, interdependence of students and nature
of the task. Some teaching implications of the findings were discussed as follows: students should be
encouraged to use multiple representations to develop problem solving strategies; students' motivation to
learn should be mastery goal oriented, teachers should encourage student participation in classroom
discussions; students should be expected to provide mathematical reasoning rather than producing the
right answer; and design of tasks should be suitable to promote skills such as mathematical reasoning
and metacognition.

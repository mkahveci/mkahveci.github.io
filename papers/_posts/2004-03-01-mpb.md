Interactivity is perceived as a vital component of education to increase the quality of
individuals’ learning in the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering. An increasing body
of research indicates that female students are especially underrepresented in those fields. In this
paper, we investigate the interactivity of female students with their instructors in the courses of
science, mathematics, and engineering. Surveying high level of interactivity would indicate the
female students’ sustained interest and success in favor of those underrepresented fields.

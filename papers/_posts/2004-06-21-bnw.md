excerpt: This article discusses a framework for understanding and defining interactivity in education, particularly for teaching complex science concepts.

A frequent argument in education literature is that delivery of instruction accompanied by real-time
interactivity will increase learning and improve instruction in practice. The trend of the use of
interactivity intensifies when content gets more abstract and instruction is delivered at a distance.
Especially, teaching complex and abstract science concepts by the use of telecommunications technology
signifies the meaning and appropriate levels of interactivity for instruction. However, definition and
forms of interactivity are often confined by instructional mediums such as computer programs and
telecommunications technologies. This article discusses the meaning of interactivity and levels of
interactivity constructed in the education literature (in the field of computer-based instruction (CBI),
cognitive science, and social science). It is concluded that the Spiral Dynamics (Beck & Cowan, 1996)
can be considered as a comprehensive framework to base conceptual parameters for the operation of interactivity in terms of human psychology and ability of learning.

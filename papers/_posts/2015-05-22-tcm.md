This project idea, presented at a European Commission and SiS.net Brokerage Event in Brussels, proposes to define a working framework for Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) in Europe using artificial intelligence. The goal is to address the need for a shared understanding of IBSE practices among stakeholders, including teachers, researchers, and policymakers. The proposed project aims to develop an AI-powered platform that would help teachers self-educate on best practices and could lead to large-scale teacher certification. The idea was conceived for submission to a Horizon 2020 call, with the objective of making STEM careers more attractive to young students and strengthening the relationship between schools and research institutions.

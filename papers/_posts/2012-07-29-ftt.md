excerpt: This symposium explores the role of affective dimensions in chemistry education, including gender and cultural differences.

The affective domain refers to feelings-based constructs such as attitudes, values, beliefs, opinions, interests, and motivation. As opposed to cognitive dimensions, the affective dimensions in science education received less attention by researchers. The main reason seems to be the practice of everyday science or what is often referred as “the nature of science” we do, which has long been assumed to be reason-driven, separated from individuals’ feelings. While this assumption may work in research laboratories with “extremely excited” graduate students, it may not be a valid assumption when teaching science at large, including at early ages. This symposium will host the research and theoretical papers that are related to the affective dimensions in Chemistry Education at all grade levels and age groups. Particular attention may include but not limited to gender differences, ethnic, and cultural varieties of these issues from teaching, learning, and research standpoints.

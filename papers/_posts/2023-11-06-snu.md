excerpt: This study investigates the impact of generative AI on academic integrity using participatory action research to inform policy and ethical education.
conference: true 
---

The authors of this proposal investigate the impact of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, on academic integrity in a U.S. college. They adopt a participatory action research approach and involve various university stakeholders in data collection and analysis. They aim to explore the benefits and challenges of using AI tools for teaching and learning, and to suggest ways to promote ethical and appropriate use of information. They also examine the current policies and practices of academic integrity in the context of AI development. The proposal is informed by a critical media/information literacy perspective and contributes to the literature on academic integrity in the age of AI.

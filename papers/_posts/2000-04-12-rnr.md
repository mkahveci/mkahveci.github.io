This paper presents the design and conceptualization of a new online evaluation system for the development of curriculum materials. With the increasing use of technology in education, a need has emerged for effective, scalable methods to evaluate the quality and instructional impact of digital and technology-enhanced learning materials. This system is designed to provide real-time, formative feedback to curriculum developers, allowing for continuous improvement of educational content. The proposed framework automates key data collection and analysis processes, reducing the burden on evaluators and providing a systematic approach to assessing a curriculum's effectiveness. It aims to address critical questions regarding student achievement, instructional quality, and overall program efficiency by using an online platform to streamline the evaluation process from initial design to final implementation.

This presentation includes some experiences in reviewing proposals submitted to FP7 Science in Society program. In specific, as being involved in the review process of 2008, 2009, and 2010-year programs in FP7 SiS program, the presenter will highlight the critical elements on the evaluation process of the proposals. Thus, the presentation relies on the evaluatorâ€™s viewpoint and may be practically beneficial to those who are actively developing grant proposals for various EU programs. In the second half of the talk, some practical tips for better grant proposals will be given. Some of those include practical tips on style, the process for writing a proposal, proof reading tips, volume of material, terminology, overview of the sections of an FP7 proposal, and budget considerations.

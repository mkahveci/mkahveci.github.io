Attitudes towards mathematics, mathematics self concept and motivation to learn mathematics of 79 students coming
from two high schools in Istanbul were measured. Three surveys were administered to the students at their schools; Fennema-Sherman scale, Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ II) and Students’ Motivation to Learn Mathematics (SMOT); having α-reliabilities .92, .92 and .93 respectively. Factorial analyses were conducted for the three scales. As a result, attitudes towards mathematics was decomposed into eight factors, labeled usefulness of mathematics content, mathematics perceived as male domain, perceived mathematics success, teacher support, perceived mathematics ability and teacher’s belief about
mathematics competency.

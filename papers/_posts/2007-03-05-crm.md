Although there is no agreement as to what interactivity and interaction mean in educational literature,
researchers are in agreement that both terms are vital for teaching and learning one way or another. This
paper includes item development stages and validity and reliability analyses of the Interactivity Survey
(the IS) that attempts to uncover the perceptions of professors working at colleges of education from
universities around the world. The pilot study with a sample size of 262 faculty members provided the
evidence of high internal consistency of the IS. All of the statistical test results and the final version of
the instrument were provided.

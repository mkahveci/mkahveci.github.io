This paper presents an on-line evaluation system designed for the development of curriculum materials. The system's main goal is to improve the quality of educational content by integrating formative and summative evaluation processes directly into the development cycle. The methodology involves a Web-based framework using questionnaires to gather feedback from various stakeholders, including students and instructors, on different dimensions of online courses and learning materials, such as content, design, and usability. The findings or key arguments suggest that implementing such an evaluation system can lead to the creation of higher-quality, more effective, and student-centered curriculum materials, ensuring that they meet learning objectives and user needs.

This paper explores the concepts of interactivity and interaction in the context of mathematics and science education. Drawing from a review of existing literature, it is observed that these terms are frequently used interchangeably without a clear, settled definition. The definitions often depend on the specific instructional media, such as computer programs or educational software, which can lead to a narrow understanding of the concepts.

We argue that true interactivity goes beyond a specific medium and is rooted in the psychological and cognitive processes of the learner. The primary goal of designing interactive learning environments is to facilitate and enhance an individual's learning. The paper examines this distinction and provides a framework for understanding interactivity as a complex, multidimensional phenomenon. This approach shifts the focus from the technological tools themselves to the underlying human dynamics and pedagogical goals that drive effective educational engagement.

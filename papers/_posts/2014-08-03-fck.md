This symposium explores the affective dimensions in chemistry education, specifically focusing on the role of educational technology and learning objects. The symposium was held on Monday, August 4, 2014, and aimed to share educational practices and pedagogy among chemical education practitioners. The paper, titled Reflecting on dual-process theories in chemistry education, was presented by Murat Kahveci. It investigates how dual-process theories can provide a framework for understanding and addressing the affective factors—such as motivation, self-efficacy, and anxiety—that influence how students learn and engage with chemistry. By integrating educational technology into the learning process, the study suggests that educators can create more effective instructional environments that cater to both cognitive and emotional aspects of learning. The use of learning objects and other technological tools is explored as a means to improve student attitudes and conceptual understanding in complex chemistry topics.

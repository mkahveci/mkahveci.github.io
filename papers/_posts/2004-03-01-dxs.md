This research examines a series of presentations, given by graduate students, in partial fulfillment of the
requirements for a core class in a doctorate program of science education in a Southeastern university in
the U.S. The interactivity component of the course was mostly provided by the integration of WWW and
computer software along with the student presentations. The interviews with four students and with the
professor were digitally stored and transcribed for the data analyses. The advantages and disadvantages
of the use of high level of interactivity were discussed.

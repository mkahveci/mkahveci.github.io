The purpose of this study was to investigate students’ motivation to use technology for learning by a comparative
analysis with respect to varying personal characteristics such as gender, grade level, content area of interest (i.e. mathematics, science, and social science), and previous experience in using technology for learning. A modified version of Fennema-Sharman attitude scale was developed and administered to K-9th-12th grade students. Reliability of the instrument, factor analysis, and GLM analysis of the results are provided in detail. As a result of the analyses, relationship between the experience in the use of technology and the students’ confidence, interest and perceived personal abilities have the statistical significant components in this research. The more experienced students in computer programming showed lower confidence in using technology. The students, who are more experienced in using graphing calculators, feel less confident than the students who are not experienced with graphing calculators. The students in the math-science departments feel themselves more confident than the other students.

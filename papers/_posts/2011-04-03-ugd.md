excerpt: This study explores chemistry majors' self-perceptions of learning and validates a modified attitude survey for reliability.

The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to investigate the self-perceptions of college students whose
major is in chemistry about learning chemistry by a comparative analysis with respect to varying personal
characteristics such as gender and grade level, and (2) to provide an evidence for the reliability of the
modified Fennema-Sherman mathematics attitude survey to measure students’ attitudes towards learning
chemistry. A modified version of Fennema-Sharman mathematics attitude scale was previously adopted
and its proof of reliability was already confirmed. In this study, further implementation of the instrument
over college students was pictured. Internal consistency analysis revealed the Cronbach alpha values
ranging from .933 to .695, which is referred as highly reliable.

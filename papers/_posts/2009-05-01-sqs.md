This study presents a detailed investigation of classical exam questions of chemistry courses in two of largest metropolitan cities of Turkey, in Istanbul and Izmit. The reference of the investigation was on the basis of the Bloom’s Taxonomy, concentrating on the cognitive levels of the questions. The types of schools were comprised of Anatolian High Schools, Ordinary High Schools, and Vocational and Commercial High Schools. Twenty chemistry teachers volunteered to participate in the study, while a total of 1593 questions from 143 exam papers were reported in the analysis. Categorical analysis by school type and city is performed. The results indicate that 33.6% of the questions were at the lower-order cognitive skills on the basis of Bloom’s Taxonomy.

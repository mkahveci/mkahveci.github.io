This study reports on the development, reliability, and validity of a newly designed **two-tier instrument** to measure chemistry students' conceptual understanding of **phase diagrams**. The research was conducted as part of a project supported by a Scientific Research Projects fund and focuses on the level of the topic taught in Physical Chemistry II for chemistry majors.

The two-tier instrument was developed based on the Turkish translation of Atkins' Physical Chemistry textbook and followed the two-tier instrument development procedure by Treagust (1988). The instrument consists of 13 multiple-choice questions (two options each) and a corresponding reason question (four options each) for a total of 26 question-reason sets. A pilot study was conducted with 51 volunteer third-year chemistry students.

The findings revealed a low number of correct answers based on conceptual knowledge. The percentage of correct responses ranged from 8% to 54%. This calculation only included correct answers given with the correct reason. The average score for the participating students was 32%, with a median score of 31%. This study aims to contribute to the limited number of conceptual learning studies that address advanced physical chemistry topics in the literature.

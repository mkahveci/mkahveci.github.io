Although there is no agreement as to what interactivity and interaction mean in educational literature,
researchers are in agreement that both terms are vital for teaching and learning one way or another. By
adding a Strand Category on ‘learning environments, teacher-student and student-student interactions,
and factors related to affecting learning,’ the National Association for Research in Science Teaching
(NARST) 2007 is an evidence of the current research trend of instructional interaction in researching
science teaching. As a part of larger study, this paper focuses on the faculty members’ perceptions about
the existence of interactivity in various instructional settings. The sample (N=2669) consists of faculty
members at colleges of education at randomly selected universities around the world. On the factor
solutions Textbook, Use of Computer, and Classroom, eight-way factorial ANOVA (General Linear Model)
was performed to elaborate the differentiations and tendencies of the perceptions of the faculty members
over eight predictors: gender, age, highest degree obtained, research interest in interactivity, present status,
learning preference, geographical region, and department.

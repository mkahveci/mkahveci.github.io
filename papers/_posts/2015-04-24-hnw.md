This project idea, presented at the IOSTE Eurasia Regional Symposium & Brokerage Event in Istanbul, Turkey, outlines a proposal to establish a working definition of Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) across Europe using artificial intelligence. The concept is intended to be submitted as a proposal for the upcoming Horizon 2020 call, SEAC.1.2014.2015, which aims to make scientific and technological careers more attractive to young students and foster interaction between schools and research institutions.


The project addresses the need for research into the current status of IBSE practices across Europe, particularly in light of previously funded FP7 projects. The core purpose is to develop a functional framework for what "inquiry" means to key stakeholders, including teachers, researchers, and policymakers, with a specific focus on actual classroom practices.


A key output of this project would be a platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help teachers self-educate on the best practices of IBSE. This platform aims to provide a path for large-scale teacher certification based on shared understandings of inquiry methodologies. The project seeks partners from universities and research institutions with prior experience in FP7 IBSE projects, as well as SMEs skilled in developing adaptive educational software with AI. At the time of the presentation, there were signs of interest from institutions such as Cambridge University, Exeter University, and Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg.

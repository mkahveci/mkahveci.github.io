excerpt: This presentation examines whether Inquiry-Based Science Education indicators adequately account for affective learning, advocating for a greater focus on emotions and attitudes.

This presentation addresses the central question of whether current Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) indicators adequately account for the complexities of human learning. It examines whether educational systems, guided by IBSE principles, still primarily operate within the cognitive domain, neglecting the affective domain.


By applying the reflective-impulsive determinants of social behavior proposed by Strack and Deutsch (2004), the presentation infers that affective constructs, such as emotions and attitudes, automatically interfere with learner behavior. It argues that these impulsive constructs do not function in isolation but instead operate in parallel with reflective, reasoning-based processes.


The presentation concludes that affective constructs should be a much greater focus of educational objectives. It recommends that future research should explicitly explore the connection between these constructs and IBSE indicators to improve student learning in science education. This approach provides a deeper understanding of student behavior, which is influenced by both anticipated consequences and forces outside of rational control.

As aligned with the main theme of the symposium, entitled Affective Dimensions in
Chemistry Education1 at the 2012 Biennial Conference on Chemical Education (BCCE) held at
Pennsylvania State University, this concept paper is presented. The focus of the presentation is on
various latent constructs that have been of interest in chemistry education research. These are
feelings-based constructs such as intuition, motivation, and self-perception. As opposed to cognitive
dimensions, affective dimensions in science or chemistry education research received less attention.
The main reason seems to be the practice of everyday science or what is often referred as “the nature
of science” we do, which has long been assumed to be reason-driven, separated from individuals’
feelings. While this assumption may work in research laboratories with “extremely excited” graduate
students, it may not be a valid assumption when teaching science at large, including at early ages.
This paper aims to present a synthesis of the respective research on affective dimensions in the
science and chemistry education context.

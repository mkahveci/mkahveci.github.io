The aim of this research is to empirically define the construct of science
teachers’ pedagogical discontentment, a construct that describes teachers’
lack of satisfaction or contentment that occurs when -they recognize a
mismatch between their own pedagogical beliefs and goals and their actual
classroom practices. From a conceptual change perspective, we explore
the meaning of pedagogical discontentment, and discuss its role in shaping
teachers’ receptivity to messages of reform. In tandem with introducing
this construct, we present an instrument to be used to measure teachers’
pedagogical discontentment, an instrument that eventually will allow
science educators to better describe the affective states of teachers entering
professional development experiences. To inform this instrument, we
conducted interviews with practicing elementary and secondary science
teachers to provide us with first-hand accounts of how teachers discuss
aspects of their current science teaching practices that they perceived as
being less effective than desired. From these interviews a group of 41
items were designed around a group of 5 subscales. The psychometric
evaluation of these items is offered, along with suggestions for the
revision of this instrument.

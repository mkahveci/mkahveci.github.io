This workshop, presented at the III. National Chemistry Education Congress in Trabzon, Turkey, aimed to guide participants in preparing and submitting project proposals for European Union funding, specifically for FP7 projects. The core objective was to equip attendees with the knowledge to craft effective proposals, emphasizing the importance of clear, concise, and persuasive writing. The workshop detailed the key elements of a successful proposal, including a clear focus, a detailed solution, a compelling vision of benefits, and a demonstration of the team's expertise. It also provided practical advice on writing in "plain English" to avoid common credibility killers such as poor grammar, cluttered layouts, and jargon. The presentation outlined the structure of an FP7 proposal, which is divided into sections covering scientific and technological quality, implementation, impact, and ethical considerations. A significant portion of the workshop was dedicated to explaining the multi-stage evaluation process, from individual expert assessment to a final panel review. The three main evaluation criteria—scientific and/or technological quality, implementation (including the consortium and resources), and impact—were discussed in detail, along with the scoring system and threshold values required for a proposal to be considered for funding. This initiative was part of a broader effort to foster a collaborative network for EU projects in the field of chemistry education in Turkey.

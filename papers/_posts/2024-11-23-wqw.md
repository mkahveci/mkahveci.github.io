This participatory action research (PAR) intends to bridge the gap between Generative AI (GenAI) tools and academic integrity in a Midwestern university in the United States. Using mixed methods, researchers analysed participants’ perceptions and strategies for using GenAI tools while upholding academic integrity. The study highlighted the institution’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges in grappling with the issue. Results pointed to the need for critical use of GenAI tools and guidelines for tackling the multifaceted impacts of the technology. The study contributes to the field with strategies to empower educators and learners in navigating the ethical landscape of GenAI in Education.

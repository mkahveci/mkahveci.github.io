Working to measure the impact of professional development activities: Offering an instrument to quantify
science teachers pedagogical discontentment This research focuses on science teachers’ pedagogical
discontentment, a construct that describes teachers’ lack of satisfaction or contentment that occurs when
teachers recognize a mismatch between their own pedagogical beliefs and their actual classroom practices.
We present an instrument to be used to measure teachers’ pedagogical discontentment, an instrument that
eventually will allow science educators to better describe the affective states of teachers entering professional
development experiences. To inform this instrument, we conducted interviews with practicing elementary
and secondary science teachers to provide us with fi rst-hand accounts of how teachers discuss aspects of
their current science teaching practices that they perceived as being less effective than desired. From these
interviews 45 items were designed around a group of 5 subscales, and this instrument was administered to
a group of 171 science teachers. Factor analysis identifi ed that 30 of these items fell out along 5 subscales,
each with a high internal consistency, confi rming the theoretical categories identifi ed in the interviews. The
revised 30-item measure was administered to a sample of 200 elementary, middle and secondary teachers.
The revised scale is described along with the psychometrics of this instrument.

This paper presents the evaluation process of large-scale grant proposals submitted to the Science-in-Society call of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The proposals specifically focus on Coordination and Support Actions involving ten or more partner institutions. Although the evaluation procedure is publicly documented in relevant call packages, this article outlines the practical, mechanical elements of the process from the perspective of an independent expert evaluator. The author's experiences stem from evaluating proposals for the FP7-Science-in-Society-SiS-2008-3 call on 'Innovative methods in science education' and the FP7-Science-in-Society-SiS-2009-1 call on 'Dissemination and use of inquiry-based teaching methods on a large scale in Europe.' The paper aims to share these practical insights and engage with science educators in Turkey on the operational aspects of the evaluation process.
